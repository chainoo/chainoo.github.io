{"updated_at": "2021-03-11T03:00:01Z", "total": 85, "data": [{"name": "v1.5.1", "tag_name": "v1.5.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.5.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus", "body": "This is an optional release of Lotus that introduces **an important fix to the WindowPoSt computation process**. The change is to wait for some confidence before drawing beacon randomness for the proof. Without this, invalid proofs might be generated as the result of a null tipset. \r\n\r\n## Splitstore\r\n\r\nThis release also introduces the splitstore, a new optional blockstore that segregates the monolithic blockstore into cold and hot regions. The hot region contains objects from the last 4-5 finalities plus all reachable objects from two finalities away. All other objects are moved to the cold region using a compaction process that executes every finality, once 5 finalities have elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe splitstore allows us to separate the two regions quite effectively, using two separate badger blockstores. The separation\r\nmeans that the live working set is much smaller, which results in potentially significant performance improvements. In addition, it means that the coldstore can be moved to a separate (bigger, slower, cheaper) disk without loss of performance.\r\n\r\nThe design also allows us to use different implementations for the two blockstores; for example, an append-only blockstore could be used for coldstore and a faster memory mapped blockstore could be used for the hotstore (eg LMDB). We plan to experiment with these options in the future.\r\n\r\nOnce the splitstore has been enabled, the existing monolithic blockstore becomes the coldstore. On the first head change notification, the splitstore will warm up the hotstore by copying all reachable objects from the current tipset into the hotstore.  All new writes go into the hotstore, with the splitstore tracking the write epoch. Once 5 finalities have elapsed, and every finality thereafter, the splitstore compacts by moving cold objects into the coldstore. There is also experimental support for garbage collection, whereby unreachable objects are simply discarded.\r\n\r\nTo enable the splitstore, add the following to config.toml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Chainstore]\r\n  EnableSplitstore = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\nOther highlights include:\r\n\r\n- Improved deal data handling - now multiple deals can be adding to sectors in parallel\r\n- Rewriten sector pledging - it now actually cares about max sealing sector limits\r\n- Better handling for sectors stuck in the RecoverDealIDs state\r\n- lotus-miner sectors extend command\r\n- Optional configurable storage path size limit\r\n- Config to disable owner/worker fallback from control addresses (useful when owner is a key on a hardware wallet)\r\n- A write log for node metadata, which can be restored as a backup when the metadata leveldb becomes corrupted (e.g. when you run out of disk space / system crashes in some bad way)\r\n\r\n##

This results in noticeable bandwidth usage due to the large size of Zcash block headers.\r\n\r\n  We now eliminate redundant requests in cases where we already know the last header in the message. This optimization is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting the config option `-nooptimize-getheaders`.\r\n\r\n- Transactions in the mempool are no longer downloaded during IBD (`zcashd` will only request block data).\r\n\r\nReduce upload traffic\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nA major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to other nodes in initial block download state.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the `-maxuploadtarget` parameter. This is *not* a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week). Moreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.\r\n\r\nThis option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default (`-maxuploadtarget=0`). The recommended minimum is 1152 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 2304MB) per day.\r\n\r\nWhitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for calculating the target.\r\n\r\nA more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in [/doc/reduce-traffic.md](/doc/reduce-traffic.md).\r\n\r\n`libzcashconsensus` replaced by `libzcash_script`\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe `libzcashconsensus` library inherited from upstream has been unusable since the Overwinter network upgrade in 2018. We made changes to signature digests similar to those made in Bitcoin's SegWit, which required additional per-input data that could not be added to the existing APIs without breaking backwards\r\ncompatibility.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it has become increasingly inaccurately named; it only covers (Zcash's subset of) the Bitcoin scripting system, and not the myriad of other consensus changes: in particular, Zcash's shielded pools.\r\n\r\nWe have now renamed the library to `libzcash_script`, and reworked it to instead focus on transparent script verification:\r\n\r\n- The script verification APIs are altered to take `consensusBranchId` and `amount` fields.\r\n- New precomputing APIs have been added that enable multiple transparent inputs on a single transaction to be verified more efficiently.\r\n- Equihash has been removed from the compiled library. The canonical Equihash validator is the [`equihash` Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/equihash) since v3.1.0.\r\n\r\nThe C++ library can be built by compiling `zcashd` with the environment variable `CONFIGURE_FLAGS=--with-libs`. It is also wrapped as the [`zcash_script` Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/zcash_script) (maintained by the Zcash Foundation for use in `zebrad`).\r\n\r\nOther P2P Changes\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe list of banned peers is now stored on disk rather than in memory. Restarting `zcashd` will no longer clear out the list of banned peers; instead the `clearbanned` RPC method can be used to manually clear the list. The `setban` RPC method can also be used to manually ban or unban a peer.\r\n\r\nBuild system updates\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- We now build with Clang 11 and Rust 1.49.\r\n- We have downgraded Boost to 1.74 to mitigate `statx`-related breakage in some container environments.", "created_at": "2021-02-24T23:27:57Z", "project": "Zcash (ZEC)", "currency": "zec", "alias": "zcash", "repo": "zcash/zcash", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.zcha.in", "explorer1": "https://zcash.tokenview.com", "doc": "https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/zcashd.html", "api": "https://zcash-rpc.github.io", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Darwinia 0.9.5", "tag_name": "v0.9.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia/releases/tag/v0.9.5", "repo_url": "https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia", "body": "## Darwinia 0.9.5\r\n|  Chain   | Runtime Spec Version |\r\n| :------: | :------------------: |\r\n| Darwinia |          22          |\r\n|   Crab   |          41          |\r\n\r\n## Boot Flag\r\n\r\n### Darwinia\r\n**Run with `--chain darwinia` or leave it empty to participate in Darwinia.** \r\n**\u4f7f\u7528 `--chain darwinia` \u6216\u4e0d\u586b\u5199\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5230 Darwinia \u7f51\u7edc\u3002**\r\n\r\n### Crab\r\n**Run with `--chain crab` to participate in Crab.** \r\n**\u4f7f\u7528 `--chain crab` \uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5230 Crab \u7f51\u7edc\u3002**\r\n\r\n## Resource\r\n\r\n### Binary\r\n|               |  Arch   | glibc (at least) | llvm (at least) | pre-build |\r\n| :-----------: | :-----: | :--------------: | :-------------: | :-------: |\r\n| General Linux | x86_64  |       2.17       |       3.8       |     \u2714\ufe0e     |\r\n|  RaspberryPi  | aarch64 |       2.23       |       3.8       |     \u2714\ufe0e     |\r\n\r\n### Docker\r\n```docker\r\ndocker pull quay.io/darwinia-network/darwinia:v0.9.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\n\r\n### Update(s)\r\n- Substrate Updates [C 476](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia-common/pull/476)\r\n### Fix(es)\r\n- None\r\n### Migration(s)\r\n- None\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Darwinia Custom\r\n#### Runtime\r\n- None\r\n#### Migration(s)\r\n- None\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Crab Custom \r\n#### Runtime\r\n- None\r\n#### Migration(s)\r\n- Remove Old Migration\r\n- Fix Crab Staking Ledger", "created_at": "2021-02-24T03:06:57Z", "project": "Darwinia (CRING)", "currency": "cring", "alias": "darwinia", "repo": "darwinia-network/darwinia", "type": "polkadot", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://crab.subscan.io", "doc": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/doc/docker.md", "doc1": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0MF60OEe-kGvTW8ggFoDg_BWt6ZMPJGrDl0Jp_HSeE/edit", "api": "https://polkadot.js.org/api/substrate/rpc.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "rippled (XRP Ledger server) Version 1.7.0", "tag_name": "1.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ripple/rippled/releases/tag/1.7.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ripple/rippled", "body": "Ripple has released version 1.7.0 of rippled, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol.

(https://blog.ripplex.io/how-ripples-c-team-cut-rippleds-memory-footprint-down-to-size/)\r\n* New Ticket feature: Tickets are a mechanism to prepare and send certain transactions outside of the normal sequence order. This version reworks and completes the implementation for Tickets after more than 6 years of development. This feature is now open for voting as the newly-introduced TicketBatch amendment, which replaces the previously-proposed Tickets amendment. The specification for this change can be found at: xrp-community/standards-drafts#16\r\n* Add Reporting Mode: The server can be compiled to operate in a new mode that serves API requests for validated ledger data without connecting directly to the peer-to-peer network. (The server needs a gRPC connection to another server that is on the peer-to-peer network.) Reporting Mode servers can share access to ledger data via Apache Cassandra and PostgreSQL to more efficiently serve API requests while peer-to-peer servers specialize in broadcasting and processing transactions. (#3609)\r\n* Optimize relaying of validation and proposal messages: Servers typically receive multiple copies of any given message from directly connected peers; in particular, consensus proposal and validation messages are often relayed with extremely high redundancy. For servers with several peers, this can cause redundant work. This commit introduces experimental code that attempts to optimize the relaying of proposals and validations by allowing servers to instruct their peers to \"squelch\" delivery of selected proposals and validations. This change is considered experimental at this time and is disabled by default because the functioning of the consensus network depends on messages propagating with high reliability through the constantly-changing peer-to-peer network. Server operators who wish to test the optimized code can enable it in their server config file.\r\n* Report server domain to other servers: Server operators now have the option to configure a domain name to be associated with their servers. The value is communicated to other servers and is also reported via the server_info API. The value is meant for third-party applications and tools to group servers together. For example, a tool that visualizes the network's topology can show how many servers are operated by different stakeholders. An operator can claim any domain, so tools should use the xrp-ledger.toml file to confirm that the domain also claims ownership of the servers.\r\n* Improve handling of peers that aren't synced: When evaluating the fitness and usefulness of an outbound peer, the code would incorrectly calculate the amount of time that the peer spent in a non-useful state. This release fixes the calculation and makes the timeout values configurable by server operators. Two new options are introduced in the 'overlay' stanza of the config file.\r\n* Persist API-configured voting settings: Previously, the amendments that a server would vote in support of or against could be configured both via the configuration file and via the \"feature\" API method. Changes made in the configuration file were only loaded at server startup; changes made via the command line take effect immediately but were not persisted across restarts. Starting with this release, changes made via the API are saved to the wallet.db database file so that they persist even if the server is restarted. Amendment voting in the config file is deprecated. The first time the server starts with v1.7.0 or higher, it reads any amendment voting settings in the config file and saves the settings to the database; on later restarts the server prints a warning message and ignores the [amendments] and [veto_amendments] stanzas of the config file. Going forward, use the feature method to view and configure amendment votes. If you want to use the config file to configure amendment votes, add a line to the [rpc_startup] stanza such as the following: [rpc_startup] { \"command\": \"feature\", \"feature\": \"FlowSortStrands\", \"vetoed\": true }\r\n* Support UNLs with future effective dates: Updates the format for the recommended validator list file format, allowing publishers to pre-publish the next recommended UNL while the current one is still valid. The server is still backwards compatible with the previous format, but the new format removes some uncertainty during the transition from one list to the next. Also, starting with this release, the server locks down and reports an error if it has no valid validator list. You can clear the error by loading a validator list from a file or by configuring a different UNL and restarting; the error also goes away on its own if the server is able to obtain a trusted validator list from the network (for example, after an network outage resolves itself).\r\n* Improve manifest relaying: Servers now propagate change messages for validators' ephemeral public keys (\"manifests\") on a best-effort basis, to make manifests more available throughout the peer-to-peer network. Previously, the server would only relay manifests from validators it trusts locally, which made it difficult to detect and track validators that are not broadly trusted.\r\n* Implement ledger forward replay feature: The server can now sync up to the network by \"playing forward\" transactions from a previously saved ledger until it catches up to the network. Compared with the default behavior of fetching the latest state and working backwards, forward replay can save time and bandwidth by reconstructing previous ledgers' state data rather than downloading the pre-calculated results from the network. As an added bonus, forward replay confirms that the rest of the network followed the same transaction processing rules as the local server when processing the intervening ledgers. This feature is considered experimental this time and can be enabled with an option in the config file.\r\n* Make the transaction job queue limit adjustable: The server uses a job queue to manage tasks, with limits on how many jobs of a particular type can be queued. The previously hard-coded limit associated with transactions is now configurable. Server operators can increase the number of transactions their server is able to queue, which may be useful if your server has a large memory capacity or you expect an influx of transactions. (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3556)\r\n* Add public_key to the Validator List method response: The Validator List method can be used to request a recommended validator list from a rippled instance. The response now includes the public key of the requested list. (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3392)\r\n* Server operators can now configure maximum inbound and outbound peers separately: The new peers_in_max and peers_out_max config options allow server operators to independently control the maximum number of inbound and outbound peers the server allows. [70c4ecc]\r\n* Improvements to shard downloading: Previously the download_shard command could only load shards over HTTPS. Compressed shards can now also be downloaded over plain HTTP. The server fully checks the data for integrity and consistency, so the encryption is not strictly necessary. When initiating multiple shard downloads, the server now returns an error if there is not enough space to store all the shards currently being downloaded.\r\n* The manifest command is now public: The manifest API method returns public information about a given validator. The required permissions have been changed so it is now part of the public API.\r\n\r\n**Bug Fixes**\r\n\r\n* Implement sticky DNS resolution for validator list retrieval: When attempting to load a validator list from a configured site, attempt to reuse the last IP that was successfully used if that IP is still present in the DNS response. (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3494).\r\n* Improve handling of RPC ledger_index argument: You can now provide the ledger_index as a numeric string. This allows you to copy and use the numeric string ledger_index value returned by certain RPC commands. Previously you could only send native JSON numbers or shortcut strings such as \"validated\" in the ledger_index field. (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3533)\r\n* Fix improper promotion of bool on return [6968da1]\r\n* Fix ledger sequence on copynode [ef53197]\r\n* Fix parsing of node public keys in manifest CLI: The previous code attempts to validate the provided node public key using a function that assumes that the encoded public key is for an account. This causes the parsing to fail. This commit fixes #3317 (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3317) by letting the caller specify the type of the public key being checked.\r\n* Fix idle peer timer: Fixes a bug where a function to remove idle peers was called every second instead of every 4 seconds. #3754 (https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3754)\r\n* Add database counters: Fix bug where DatabaseRotateImp::getBackend and ::sync utilized the writable backend without a lock. ::getBackend was replaced with ::getCounters.\r\n* Improve online_delete configuration and DB tuning [6e9051e]\r\n* Improve handling of burst writes in NuDB database ( https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3662 )\r\n* Fix excessive logging after disabling history shards. Previously if you configured the server with a shard store, then disabled it, the server output excessive warning messages about the shard limit being exceeded.\r\n* Fixed some issues with negotiating link compression. ( https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3705 )\r\n* Fixed a potential thread deadlock with history sharding.

Such an attack would not have created any risk of loss of funds or of consensus failure.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from versions older than v1.2.x, please also see the [v1.2.2-stable release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/releases/tag/v1.2.2).\r\n\r\nDocker Images\r\n\r\n* geth: us.gcr.io/celo-org/geth:1.2.3\r\n* geth-all: us.gcr.io/celo-org/geth-all:1.2.3", "created_at": "2021-02-22T14:54:08Z", "project": "Celo (CELO)", "currency": "celo", "alias": "celo", "repo": "celo-org/celo-blockchain", "type": "fork eth", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.celo.org", "doc": "https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/mainnet/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet", "api": "https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API", "add_time": "2020-07-07T07:00:00Z"}, {"name": "dcrd v1.6.1", "tag_name": "release-v1.6.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.6.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/decred/dcrd", "body": "# dcrd v1.6.1\r\n\r\nThis is a patch release of dcrd which includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Correct a hard to hit issue where connections might not be reestablished after a network outage under some rare circumstances\r\n- Allow stakeholders to make use of the staking system to force proof-of-work miners to upgrade to the latest version so voting on the new consensus changes can commence\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThis patch release consists of 3 commits from 1 contributor which total to 3 files changed, 30 additional lines of code, and 9 deleted lines of code.\r\n\r\nAll commits since the last release may be viewed on GitHub [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/compare/release-v1.6.0...release-v1.6.1).\r\n\r\n### Protocol and network:\r\n\r\n- server: Notify block mgr later and track ntfn ([decred/dcrd#2588](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2588))\r\n- server: Force PoW upgrade to v8 ([decred/dcrd#2597](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2597))\r\n\r\n### Misc:\r\n\r\n- release: Bump for 1.6.1 ([decred/dcrd#2600](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2600))\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors (alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n- Dave Collins", "created_at": "2021-02-19T20:34:41Z", "project": "Decred (DCR)", "currency": "dcr", "alias": "decred", "repo": "decred/dcrd", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://mainnet.decred.org", "explorer1": "https://dcrdata.decred.org/", "doc": "https://docs.decred.org/advanced/full-node", "api": "https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/master/docs/json_rpc_api.mediawiki", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.6.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/releases/tag/v1.6.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn", "body": "## New Features\r\n- Introduced KES (Klaytn Endpoint System) (#707, #709)\r\n  -

You will need to make sure you have upgraded your miner before this time in order to connect to the 2.4 network.\r\n\r\nThe release introduces SPoRA - the new consensus mechanism aiming to promote further replication of the dataset, and reduce the energy consumed by the network by trade hashing expenditure for throughput of data access links. See more about the design [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/ans-103/ans/ANS-103.md).\r\n\r\nThe estimated USD to AR rate is fixed in the release version due to the high uncertainty about the difficulty change at the fork block. A follow-up hard fork will re-enable the dynamic difficulty-based price estimation. Thereby the /price endpoint would now return the precise amount to pay, not a pessimistic estimation of it.\r\n\r\nIt may take significantly longer than usual to mine the fork block, leading to disruption in usage of the network for this period.\r\n\r\n**HTTP API changes**\r\n\r\n- The \"reward_pool\", \"block_size\", and \"weave_size\" block fields are served as JSON strings starting from the fork block.\r\n\r\n**Transaction verification changes**\r\n\r\n- The \"target\" field must be empty when no tokens are transferred. For transfer transactions, the size of the \"target\" field must be 32 bytes.\r\n- A bug is fixed where the nodes [would not verify some valid RSA PSS signatures](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/pull/286).\r\n\r\n**New features and improvements**\r\n\r\n- A new logging system is introduced. Logs are now written to \"logs/arweave@127.0.0.1.*\" and rotated automatically. The messages are one-liners.\r\n- The \"polling\" command line option is an integer now - the polling frequency in seconds.\r\n- The memory footprint is reduced.\r\n\r\nThe release also includes various performance improvements. \r\n\r\n**Bug fixes**\r\n\r\n- A bug was fixed where the miner won't log the \"[Stage 3/3]\" message about the confirmed mined blocks.\r\n\r\n**Upgrade instructions**\r\n\r\nN.2.4.0.0 comes with the prebuilt binaries for the Linux and Darwin x86_64 platforms.\r\n\r\nDownload the corresponding archive and unpack it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntar -xzf arweave-2.4.0.0.linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to unpack it inside a dedicated directory. You can always move this directory around, but the miner may not work if you move only some of the files. The weave data would, by default, be stored in this directory, too, but it can be overridden using the data_dir command-line argument.\r\nThe archive contents look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/  data/  erts-10.3/  lib/  releases/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run the miner, execute ./bin/start <arguments>. See the mining guide for more details.\r\nIf your OS/platform architecture is not in the list, check README for how to build the miner from sources.\r\n\r\nIf you want to run the miner from the existing Git folder, execute the following command to upgrade:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit fetch --all --tags && git checkout -f N.2.4.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now run the miner using the arweave-server script.\r\n\r\n**Support**\r\n\r\nFor more details on how to run a mining node, please see our mining guide - https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

This is directly useful and is also one of the significant building blocks for the later Goguen smart contracts.\r\n\r\nA launchpad testnet for the native token functionality has been running since December, using the cardano-node 1.24.2 release. This 1.25.1 release contains relatively minor changes for the Mary era compared to the 1.24.2 release. It is nevertheless not compatible with the 1.24.2 version and the existing testnet. The launchpad testnet ***will not*** be restarted and will remain on 1.24.2. Public testnet and staging have been upgraded to 1.25.1. If you have already tested integration with the existing launchpad testnet then no new integration work is expected for this release other than upgrading the node version and moving to the staging or public testnet.\r\n\r\nExchanges and other users that integrate closely with Cardano **must take action** to test their integration before the transition takes place on mainnet. Exchanges can use launchpad or staging, SPOs can use staging, and everyone should use public testnet once it forks. Staging will go through the Mary hard fork on 28th January, and public testnet will go through the Mary hard fork during week commencing 1st February. The native token functionality does have an impact for all custom wallet implementations: it is not a feature that can be ignored and remain compatible. All addresses are capable of receiving native tokens.\r\n\r\nStake Pool Operators (SPOs) and Exchanges should take note that the metric namespace has undergone consolidation, so all metrics now reside in `cardano.node.metrics`:\r\n- cardano.node.Forge.metrics.* -> cardano.node.metrics.Forge.*\r\n- cardano.node.ChainDB.metrics.* -> cardano.node.metrics.ChainDB.*\r\n- cardano.node.BlockFetchDecision.connectedPeers -> cardano.node.metrics.connectedPeers\r\n\r\nThe node configs require no changes, but allow dropping entries that became redundant: wherever `cardano.node.Forge.metrics.*`, `cardano.node.ChainDB.metrics.*` or `cardano.node.BlockFetchDecision.connectedPeers` were mentioned, those entries can be removed.  Only `cardano.node.metric` needs to remain. Please see #2281 for further details.\r\n\r\nThis release uses a new cabal snapshot so could be rather resource intensive when building for the first time.\r\n\r\n## Node changes\r\n- All metrics now use a common name prefix `cardano.node.metrics`. This requires a one-off change to the node configuration to route all metrics to the metrics backend and not have them in the log files. This should reduce the number of such changes in future. (#2281)\r\n- More detailed tracer output for protocol tracers (#2178)\r\n\r\n## Consensus changes\r\n- Improve the handling of the encoding of local IPC queries by older clients that do not understand later hard forks. In future this should mean that clients that do not understand a hard fork only fail at the time of the hard fork itself, and not earlier when the update proposal is confirmed ([#2818](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2818))\r\n- New query for rewards provenance. This is intended to help wallets explain more details about rewards, and to help SPOs and users better understand how pools' performance and ranking are calculated. This is not yet supported in the CLI in this release. ([#2830](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2830))\r\n- Support for using multiple leader credentials for the purpose of running large scale benchmarks. It supported in testnets only, not mainnet ([#2832](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2832))\r\n- Support in testnets for skipping initial eras. This makes it easier and quicker to automate the setup of Cardano-mode testnets that start in later eras, such as Allegra or Mary. This enables simplifications in the setup for integration tests or benchmarks ([#2811](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2811)) \r\n- A first draft of a technical report on the design and the internals of the Cardano consensus and storage layer ([#2663](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2663), [#2838](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2838), [#2841](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2841), [#2842](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2842), [#2853](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2853))\r\n\r\n## Ledger changes\r\n- Enforce the size of multi-asset names, to match the specification ([#2074](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2074))\r\n- Minor change to the ledger CDDL binary specification for the Mary era: restrict the range of multi-asset values to -2^63..2^63-1 where previously the allowed range was -2^64..2^64-1 ([#2092](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2092))\r\n- Rename fields in the ledger's CDDL binary specification for clarity and consistency, but no actual changes to the binary format ([#2045](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2045))\r\n- Change the minimum ada UTxO value formula for multi-asset values to better reflect the resource costs and to pass on savings (in the form of a lower minimum ada UTxO value) for applications that use smaller asset bundles by sharing policy ids or using shorter asset names ([#2107](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2107))\r\n- Improvements to the size of the internal storage format of multi-asset values, enabling a lower minimum ada UTxO value for multi-asset output values ([#2083](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2083))\r\n- Restrict the maximum size of multi-asset output values ([#2099](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2099))\r\n- Terminology change: the metadata section is renamed to \"auxiliary data\" to distinguish it from the existing transaction metadata ([#2052](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2052))\r\n- Extra documentation on native tokens ([#2046](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2046))\r\n- Progress on the new Alonzo era ([#2022](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2022), [#2055](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2055), [#2061](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2061), [#2062](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2062), [#2067](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2067), [#2077](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2077), [#2087](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2087), [#2088](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2088), [#2095](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs/pull/2095))\r\n\r\n## Network changes\r\n- Internal infrastructure to support seeding the P2P graph construction from the SPO relays registered on the chain, weighted by stake ([#2535](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2535), [#2536](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2536))\r\n- Introduce v6 of the node-to-node protocol where we reverse the initial agency of the tx-submission protocol to match the others. This is preparation for the P2P governor which requires the initial agency for mini-protocols to be uniform ([#2807](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2807))\r\n- Introduce v8 of the node-to-client protocol with an extension to the local query protocol that allows acquiring the point at the node's current chain tip, without having to provide that point explicitly. Using this simplifies things for node clients for the common use case where the current tip is needed, and eliminates a rare race condition ([#2875](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2875))\r\n- Fix a resource leak for chain-sync clients ([#2235](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2235), [#2870](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2870), [#2888](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2888))\r\n- Tracing improvements for the mux component ([#2794](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/2794))\r\n\r\n## Cardano-cli changes\r\n- Allow creating transactions with no outputs (#2223, #2226)\r\n- Improved error messages for syntax errors in out-of-range lovelace quantities in transaction outputs (#2063, #2079)\r\n- Improved reference documentation for simple scripts and their use (#2165)\r\n- Remove support for changing the delegation from Genesis keys to operational keys in the Byron era. This feature was never used on the mainnet during the Byron era. (#2219)\r\n- Clearer usage information in the CLI --help output (#2203)\r\n\r\n## Cardano-api changes\r\n- New IPC modules for easier interaction with the node, including support for all existing local state queries (#2230, #2238, #2263, #2277, #2286)\r\n- API support for Byron era update proposals and votes (#2209, #2271)\r\n- Make Cardano.Api the primary public module for the API.\r\n- API support for serialising multi-asset PolicyId and AssetName (#2270)\r\n- API for pretty-printing JSON output (#2103)\r\n- More precise error cases for tx outputs that are out of range (#2217)\r\n- Host up-to-date generated API documentation via github https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node/ (#2273, #2276, #2278)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- [Cardano Node

This release includes binaries, which can be downloaded below.\r\n\r\nAbout this release\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDash Core 0.16.1.1 is a hotfix release of the Dash Core 0.16.x.x series. This release contains a bugfix and we consider this a stable release. You can find detailed release notes at https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.16.1.1/doc/release-notes.md.\r\n\r\nVerification of Downloads\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis release was signed by https://keybase.io/pasta (GPG fingerprint: `2959 0362 EC87 8A81 FD3C 202B 5252 7BED ABE8 7984`).\r\n\r\nIt is important to verify the binaries you download by following one of these guides:\r\n - [Windows](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/wallets/dashcore/installation-windows.html?#verifying-dash-core)\r\n - [MacOS](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/wallets/dashcore/installation-macos.html?#verifying-dash-core)\r\n - [Linux](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/wallets/dashcore/installation-linux.html?#verifying-dash-core)\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\r\n-----------------------\r\nThere was an unexpected behaviour of the \"Encrypt wallet\" menu item for unencrypted wallets which was showing users the \"Decrypt wallet\" dialog instead. This was a GUI only issue, internal encryption logic and RPC behaviour were not affected.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThanks go out to all Dash Core contributors, everyone who submitted issues, reviewed pull requests or helped translating on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/dash/) and also to [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) Developers.", "created_at": "2020-11-15T21:43:14Z", "project": "Dash (DASH)", "currency": "dash", "alias": "dash", "repo": "dashpay/dash", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.dash.org", "doc": "https://docs.dash.org/zh_CN/stable/masternodes/setup.html#option-1-automated-installation-using-dashman", "api": "https://dashcore.readme.io/docs/core-api-ref-http-rest-quick-reference", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Not Found", "tag_name": "", "html_url": "https://github.com/cypherium/cypherBFTBin", "repo_url": "https://github.com/cypherium/cypherBFTBin", "body": "", "created_at": "2020-11-04T04:00:00Z", "project": "Cypherium (CPH)", "currency": "cph", "alias": "cph", "repo": "cypherium/cypherBFTBin", "type": "fork eth", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.cypherium.io", "doc": "https://www.cypherium.io", "api": "https://www.cypherium.io", "add_time": "2020-11-04T04:00:00Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "release@1.0.8n", "html_url": "https://github.com/yottachain/YTDataNode/commit/7a69bbcb5869d5900fac5cae1d73b1a840ebd93f", "repo_url": "https://github.com/yottachain/YTDataNode", "body": "publish 1.0.8n", "created_at": "2020-10-21T02:44:07Z", "project": "YOTTA (YTA)", "currency": "yta", "alias": "yta", "repo": "yottachain/YTDataNode", "type": "eos", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://yottascan.io/zh/overview", "doc": "https://www.yottachain.io/zh/developer/", "api": "https://static.yottachain.net/download/YTA%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3%20.pdf", "add_time": "2020-11-04T04:00:00Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.0.22", "html_url": "https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/releases/tag/v2.0.22", "repo_url": "https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen", "body": "Binaries\r\n=========\r\nWindows and macOS binaries are signed with a valid certificate,\r\nsee included instructions.txt for Win/Mac command line wallets.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=========\r\nDebian package dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDepends amd64: libc6 (>= 2.18), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.2), libgomp1 (>= 4.9), libstdc++6 (>= 5.2)\r\nDepends arm64: libc6 (>= 2.25), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.2), libgomp1 (>= 4.9), libstdc++6 (>= 7)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\n* Hard Fork at mainnet block 835968/testnet block 735700 with minor changes to OP_CBAH handling\r\n* Extend OP_CBAH unit tests\r\n* Security hardening of TLS P2P code, only allow PFS ciphers, limit TLS versions to 1.2/1.3\r\n* Extend TLS unit tests\r\n* Extend the 'getblock' RPC command with additional verbosity level, adding transaction information in the format of the getrawtransaction RPC call\r\n* Add fetch-params.ps1 powershell script for Windows trusted setup DL and verification\r\n* Fix for gcc10 compatibility\r\n* Updates of dependencies OpenSSL, Univalue, libsodium\r\n* Rename GH organization to HorizenOfficial", "created_at": "2020-10-19T18:34:28Z", "project": "Horizen (ZEN)", "currency": "zen", "alias": "zen", "repo": "HorizenOfficial/zen", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.zensystem.io", "explorer1": "https://zen.tokenview.com", "doc": "https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen-node-docker", "api": "https://docs.horizen.io/en/latest/reference/index.html", "add_time": "2020-11-30T12:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Release 3.3.0", "tag_name": "v3.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ucacoin/Ucacoin2/releases/tag/v3.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ucacoin/Ucacoin2", "body": "# Mandatory Update:\r\n\r\n###  Users with updating from a previous version will require a full resync of their local blockchain from either the P2P network or by way of the **bootstrap**.\r\n### If you didn't go with **bootstrap** than it will be ask for resync **when you start wallet** .

It also adds two new transaction types to anchor arbitrary data in the blockchain. As an experimental feature, several new commands were added to support querying any Bitcoin balance.\r\n\r\nWhile this release is not mandatory and doesn't change the consensus rules of the Omni Layer protocol, an upgrade is nevertheless recommended.\r\n\r\nUpgrading from 0.8.2, 0.8.1 or 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of contents\r\n=================\r\n\r\n- [Omni Core v0.9.0](#omni-core-v082)\r\n- [Upgrading and downgrading](#upgrading-and-downgrading)\r\n  - [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade)\r\n  - [Downgrading](#downgrading)\r\n  - [Compatibility with Bitcoin Core](#compatibility-with-bitcoin-core)\r\n- [Improvements](#improvements)\r\n  - [Use wrapped Segrated Witness scripts for new addresses](#use-wrapped-segrated-witness-scripts-for-new-addresses)\r\n  - [New transactions to anchor arbitrary data](#new-transactions-to-anchor-arbitrary-data)\r\n  - [Experimental querying of any Bitcoin balance](#experimental-querying-of-any-bitcoin-balance)\r\n  - [Several test and under the hood improvements](#several-test-and-under-the-hood-improvements)\r\n- [Change log](#change-log)\r\n- [Credits](#credits)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrading and downgrading\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nHow to upgrade\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIf you are running Bitcoin Core or an older version of Omni Core, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down, then copy the new version of `omnicored`, `omnicore-cli` and `omnicore-qt`. On Microsoft Windows the setup routine can be used to automate these steps.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0, the database of Omni Core is reconstructed, which can easily consume several hours. During the first startup historical Omni Layer transactions are reprocessed and Omni Core will not be usable for several hours up to more than a day. The progress of the initial scan is reported on the console, the GUI and written to the `debug.log`. The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.\r\n\r\nUpgrading from 0.8.1 or 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.\r\n\r\nDowngrading\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nDowngrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.\r\n\r\nCompatibility with Bitcoin Core\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nOmni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n============\r\n\r\nUse wrapped Segrated Witness scripts for new addresses\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen using `getnewaddress` new addresses are generated with Segrated Witness scripts wrapped in P2SH. On mainnet, those addresses start with a `3` instead of `1`. This upgrade lowers transaction fees significantly and should not break integrations.\r\n\r\nIn case you need to fall back to the legacy address generation, please start Omni Core with `addresstype=legacy` configuration option.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew transactions to anchor arbitrary data\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTwo new transaction types were added to anchor arbitrary data on-chain. This allows the creation of overlay protocols on top of the Omni protocol, or can simply be used to store any form of data in the blockchain.\r\n\r\n**Example of sending and pulling data**\r\n\r\nSending the hex-encoded data `497420776f726b7321`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ omnicore-cli \"omni_sendanydata\" \"2N5bnBsaVdPBuK5xKCQ5ZTXnofBfwSxU2Th\" \"497420776f726b7321\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\n4c9776f28e7015e840a05cb0955c22fd6917cf264032ad694e5d1ee0d8ebf745\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a confirmation:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ omnicore-cli \"omni_gettransaction\" \"4c9776f28e7015e840a05cb0955c22fd6917cf264032ad694e5d1ee0d8ebf745\"\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"txid\": \"4c9776f28e7015e840a05cb0955c22fd6917cf264032ad694e5d1ee0d8ebf745\",\r\n  \"fee\": \"0.00003240\",\r\n  \"sendingaddress\": \"2N5bnBsaVdPBuK5xKCQ5ZTXnofBfwSxU2Th\",\r\n  \"ismine\": true,\r\n  \"version\": 0,\r\n  \"type_int\": 200,\r\n  \"type\": \"Embed any data\",\r\n  \"data\": \"497420776f726b7321\",\r\n  \"valid\": true,\r\n  \"blockhash\": \"7c1e8be2c48fa6062b2b8ff6de7b2e1bc14b7d281d961979ed195a86399abd75\",\r\n  \"blocktime\": 1599469254,\r\n  \"positioninblock\": 1,\r\n  \"block\": 367,\r\n  \"confirmations\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details, please see the descriptions of the new RPCs:\r\n\r\n- [omni_sendanydata](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_sendanydata)\r\n- [omni_createpayload_anydata](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_createpayload_anydata)\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimental querying of any Bitcoin balance\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA new optional database was added, which allows the user to query any Bitcoin balance or list transactions of any addresses. Please note, this feature is experimental and not enabled per default. To enable the new database, restart Omni Core with `experimental-btc-balances=1` configuration option.\r\n\r\n**When enabling both of these options, Omni Core creates a new database for Bitcoin balances. This step can take a very long time of up to multiple days on mainnet. More than 300 GB of additional disk space are required!**\r\n\r\nPlease see the descriptions of the new RPCs for more details:\r\n\r\n- [getaddresstxids](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#getaddresstxids)\r\n- [getaddressdeltas](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#getaddressdeltas)\r\n- [getaddressbalance](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#getaddressbalance)\r\n- [getaddressutxos](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#getaddressutxos)\r\n- [getaddressmempool](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#xxxxx)\r\n- [getblockhashes](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#getblockhashes)\r\n- [getspentinfo](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#getspentinfo)\r\n\r\n**Please also note, this feature is experimental and may provide inaccurate results.**\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral test and under the hood improvements\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo prepare Omni Core for Bitcoin Core 0.20+, OpenSSL was removed and replaced. OmniJ related tests were upgraded to use JDK 11. New tests for funded transactions were added and old bash tests were converted to the newer functional test framework.

Special blocks, such as election blocks, settlement blocks are packaged and traded according to normal logic[#1461](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go/issues/1461).\r\n4. RLP coding optimization of WASM contract[#1449](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go/issues/1449).\r\n5. Add the txpool.cacheSize parameter, when a certain number of transactions are received, the transaction will be moved from queue to pending[#1469](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go/pull/1469).\r\n6. Adjust the default gasLimit of the block to 201600000 to increase the capacity of a single block[#1469](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go/pull/1469).\r\n7. When the block is executed, the 'from' is first obtained from txpool, if not, calculated it in parallel[#1469](https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/PlatON-Go/pull/1469).\r\n\r\n- Changes\r\n\r\n1.

This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.\r\n\r\nHow to Upgrade\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\u00a0`/Applications/Litecoin-Qt`\u00a0(on Mac) or\u00a0`litecoind`/`litecoin-qt`\u00a0(on Linux).\r\n\r\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\r\n\r\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported. However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them.\r\n\r\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than 10.10. Additionally, Litecoin Core does not yet change appearance when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n============\r\n\r\nWallet GUI\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and (2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control input selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when switching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended not to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.\r\n\r\nNotable changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nMining\r\n------\r\n\r\n-   Calls to\u00a0`getblocktemplate`\u00a0will fail if the segwit rule is not specified. Calling\u00a0`getblocktemplate`\u00a0without segwit specified is almost certainly a misconfiguration since doing so results in lower rewards for the miner. Failed calls will produce an error message describing how to enable the segwit rule.\r\n\r\nConfiguration option changes\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n-   A warning is printed if an unrecognized section name is used in the configuration file. Recognized sections are\u00a0`[test]`,\u00a0`[main]`, and\u00a0`[regtest]`.\r\n-   Four new options are available for configuring the maximum number of messages that ZMQ will queue in memory (the \"high water mark\") before dropping additional messages. The default value is 1,000, the same as was used for previous releases. See the\u00a0[ZMQ documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage)\u00a0for details.\r\n-   The\u00a0`rpcallowip`\u00a0option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces. Instead, the\u00a0`rpcbind`\u00a0parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration. If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g.\u00a0`docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:9332:9332`\u00a0(this is an extra\u00a0`:9332`\u00a0over the normal Docker port specification).\r\n-   The\u00a0`rpcpassword`\u00a0option now causes a startup error if the password set in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it's ambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a comment.\r\n-   The\u00a0`whitelistforcerelay`\u00a0option is used to relay transactions from whitelisted peers even when not accepted to the mempool. This option now defaults to being off, so that changes in policy and disconnect/ban behavior will not cause a node that is whitelisting another to be dropped by peers. Users can still explicitly enable this behavior with the command line option (and may want to consider\u00a0[contacting](mailto:contact@litecoin.org)\u00a0the Litecoin Core project to let us know about their use-case, as this feature could be deprecated in the future).\r\n\r\nWallet changes\r\n==============\r\n\r\nWhen creating a transaction with a fee above\u00a0`-maxtxfee`\u00a0(default 0.1 LTC), the RPC commands\u00a0`walletcreatefundedpsbt`\u00a0and\u00a0`fundrawtransaction`\u00a0will now fail instead of rounding down the fee. Beware that the\u00a0`feeRate`\u00a0argument is specified in LTC per kilobyte, not litoshi per byte.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   A new short\u00a0[document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\u00a0about the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an RPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different subsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state. A note is added to the\u00a0[REST interface documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)\u00a0indicating that the same rules apply.\r\n-   Further information is added to the\u00a0[JSON-RPC documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\u00a0about how to secure this interface.\r\n-   A new\u00a0[document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/litecoin-conf.md)\u00a0about the\u00a0`litecoin.conf`\u00a0file describes how to use it to configure Litecoin Core.\r\n-   A new document introduces Litecoin Core's BIP174\u00a0[Partially-Signed Litecoin Transactions (PSBT)](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md)\u00a0interface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively work to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions. This is useful for offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin implementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need to interact to generate a complete transaction.\r\n-   The\u00a0[output script descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)\u00a0documentation has been updated with information about new features in this still-developing language for describing the output scripts that a wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as which addresses it wants to know received payments. The language is currently used in multiple new and updated RPCs described in these release notes and is expected to be adapted to other RPCs and to the underlying wallet structure.\r\n\r\nBuild system changes\r\n====================\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`--disable-bip70`\u00a0option may be passed to\u00a0`./configure`\u00a0to prevent Litecoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment protocol or from linking libssl. As the payment protocol has exposed Litecoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don't need BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their exposure to future vulnerabilities.\r\n-   The minimum required version of Qt (when building the GUI) has been increased from 5.2 to 5.5.1 (the\u00a0[depends system](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/depends/README.md)\u00a0provides 5.9.7)\r\n\r\nNew RPCs\r\n========\r\n\r\n-   `getnodeaddresses`\u00a0returns peer addresses known to this node. It may be used to find nodes to connect to without using a DNS seeder.\r\n-   `listwalletdir`\u00a0returns a list of wallets in the wallet directory (either the default wallet directory or the directory configured by the\u00a0`-walletdir`\u00a0parameter).\r\n-   `getrpcinfo`\u00a0returns runtime details of the RPC server. At the moment, it returns an array of the currently active commands and how long they've been running.\r\n-   `deriveaddresses`\u00a0returns one or more addresses corresponding to an\u00a0[output descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n-   `getdescriptorinfo`\u00a0accepts a descriptor and returns information about it, including its computed checksum.\r\n-   `joinpsbts`\u00a0merges multiple distinct PSBTs into a single PSBT. The multiple PSBTs must have different inputs. The resulting PSBT will contain every input and output from all of the PSBTs. Any signatures provided in any of the PSBTs will be dropped.\r\n-   `analyzepsbt`\u00a0examines a PSBT and provides information about what the PSBT contains and the next steps that need to be taken in order to complete the transaction. For each input of a PSBT,\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0provides information about what information is missing for that input, including whether a UTXO needs to be provided, what pubkeys still need to be provided, which scripts need to be provided, and what signatures are still needed. Every input will also list which role is needed to complete that input, and\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0will also list the next role in general needed to complete the PSBT.\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0will also provide the estimated fee rate and estimated virtual size of the completed transaction if it has enough information to do so.\r\n-   `utxoupdatepsbt`\u00a0searches the set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to find the outputs being spent by the partial transaction. PSBTs need to have the UTXOs being spent to be provided because the signing algorithm requires information from the UTXO being spent. For segwit inputs, only the UTXO itself is necessary. For non-segwit outputs, the entire previous transaction is needed so that signers can be sure that they are signing the correct thing. Unfortunately, because the UTXO set only contains UTXOs and not full transactions,\u00a0`utxoupdatepsbt`\u00a0will only add the UTXO for segwit inputs.\r\n\r\nUpdated RPCs\r\n============\r\n\r\nNote: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the Low-level Changes section below.\r\n\r\n-   `getpeerinfo`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`minfeefilter`\u00a0field set to the peer's BIP133 fee filter. You can use this to detect that you have peers that are willing to accept transactions below the default minimum relay fee.\r\n-   The mempool RPCs, such as\u00a0`getrawmempool`\u00a0with\u00a0`verbose=true`, now return an additional \"bip125-replaceable\" value indicating whether the transaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and miners to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of the same inputs.\r\n-   `settxfee`\u00a0previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee below the allowed minimums. It now prints a warning. The special value of \"0\" may still be used to request the minimum value.\r\n-   `getaddressinfo`\u00a0now provides an\u00a0`ischange`\u00a0field indicating whether the wallet used the address in a change output.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0has been updated to support P2WSH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH, and P2SH-P2WSH. Requests for P2WSH and P2SH-P2WSH accept an additional\u00a0`witnessscript`\u00a0parameter.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`warnings`\u00a0field for each request with an array of strings explaining when fields are being ignored or are inconsistent, if there are any.\r\n-   `getaddressinfo`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`solvable`\u00a0boolean field when Litecoin Core knows enough about the address's scriptPubKey, optional redeemScript, and optional witnessScript in order for the wallet to be able to generate an unsigned input spending funds sent to that address.\r\n-   The\u00a0`getaddressinfo`,\u00a0`listunspent`, and\u00a0`scantxoutset`\u00a0RPCs now return an additional\u00a0`desc`\u00a0field that contains an output descriptor containing all key paths and signing information for the address (except for the private key). The\u00a0`desc`\u00a0field is only returned for\u00a0`getaddressinfo`\u00a0and\u00a0`listunspent`\u00a0when the address is solvable.\r\n-   `importprivkey`\u00a0will preserve previously-set labels for addresses or public keys corresponding to the private key being imported. For example, if you imported a watch-only address with the label \"cold wallet\" in earlier releases of Litecoin Core, subsequently importing the private key would default to resetting the address's label to the default empty-string label (\"\"). In this release, the previous label of \"cold wallet\" will be retained. If you optionally specify any label besides the default when calling\u00a0`importprivkey`, the new label will be applied to the address.\r\n-   See the\u00a0[Mining](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/v0.18.1rc1/doc/release-notes-litecoin.md#mining)\u00a0section for changes to\u00a0`getblocktemplate`.\r\n-   `getmininginfo`\u00a0now omits\u00a0`currentblockweight`\u00a0and\u00a0`currentblocktx`\u00a0when a block was never assembled via RPC on this node.\r\n-   The\u00a0`getrawtransaction`\u00a0RPC & REST endpoints no longer check the unspent UTXO set for a transaction. The remaining behaviors are as follows: 1. If a blockhash is provided, check the corresponding block. 2. If no blockhash is provided, check the mempool. 3. If no blockhash is provided but txindex is enabled, also check txindex.\r\n-   `unloadwallet`\u00a0is now synchronous, meaning it will not return until the wallet is fully unloaded.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0now supports importing of addresses from descriptors. A \"desc\" parameter can be provided instead of the \"scriptPubKey\" in a request, as well as an optional range for ranged descriptors to specify the start and end of the range to import. Descriptors with key origin information imported through\u00a0`importmulti`\u00a0will have their key origin information stored in the wallet for use with creating PSBTs. More information about descriptors can be found\u00a0[here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n-   `listunspent`\u00a0has been modified so that it also returns\u00a0`witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output.\r\n-   `createwallet`\u00a0now has an optional\u00a0`blank`\u00a0argument that can be used to create a blank wallet. Blank wallets do not have any keys or HD seed. They cannot be opened in software older than 0.18. Once a blank wallet has a HD seed set (by using\u00a0`sethdseed`) or private keys, scripts, addresses, and other watch only things have been imported, the wallet is no longer blank and can be opened in 0.17.x. Encrypting a blank wallet will also set a HD seed for it.\r\n\r\nDeprecated or removed RPCs\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n-   `signrawtransaction`\u00a0is removed after being deprecated and hidden behind a special configuration option in version 0.17.0.\r\n-   The 'account' API is removed after being deprecated in v0.17. The 'label' API was introduced in v0.17 as a replacement for accounts. See the\u00a0[release notes from v0.17](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.md#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet)\u00a0for a full description of the changes from the 'account' API to the 'label' API.\r\n-   `addwitnessaddress`\u00a0is removed after being deprecated in version 0.16.0.\r\n-   `generate`\u00a0is deprecated and will be fully removed in a subsequent major version. This RPC is only used for testing, but its implementation reached across multiple subsystems (wallet and mining), so it is being deprecated to simplify the wallet-node interface. Projects that are using\u00a0`generate`\u00a0for testing purposes should transition to using the\u00a0`generatetoaddress`\u00a0RPC, which does not require or use the wallet component. Calling\u00a0`generatetoaddress`\u00a0with an address returned by the\u00a0`getnewaddress`\u00a0RPC gives the same functionality as the old\u00a0`generate`\u00a0RPC. To continue using\u00a0`generate`\u00a0in this version, restart litecoind with the\u00a0`-deprecatedrpc=generate`\u00a0configuration option.\r\n-   Be reminded that parts of the\u00a0`validateaddress`\u00a0command have been deprecated and moved to\u00a0`getaddressinfo`. The following deprecated fields have moved to\u00a0`getaddressinfo`:\u00a0`ismine`,\u00a0`iswatchonly`,\u00a0`script`,\u00a0`hex`,\u00a0`pubkeys`,\u00a0`sigsrequired`,\u00a0`pubkey`,\u00a0`embedded`,\u00a0`iscompressed`,\u00a0`label`,\u00a0`timestamp`,\u00a0`hdkeypath`,\u00a0`hdmasterkeyid`.\r\n-   The\u00a0`addresses`\u00a0field has been removed from the\u00a0`validateaddress`\u00a0and\u00a0`getaddressinfo`\u00a0RPC methods. This field was confusing since it referred to public keys using their P2PKH address. Clients should use the\u00a0`embedded.address`\u00a0field for P2SH or P2WSH wrapped addresses, and\u00a0`pubkeys`\u00a0for inspecting multisig participants.\r\n\r\nREST changes\r\n============\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`/rest/blockhashbyheight/`\u00a0endpoint is added for fetching the hash of the block in the current best blockchain based on its height (how many blocks it is after the Genesis Block).\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n-   A new Window menu is added alongside the existing File, Settings, and Help menus. Several items from the other menus that opened new windows have been moved to this new Window menu.\r\n-   In the Send tab, the checkbox for \"pay only the required fee\" has been removed. Instead, the user can simply decrease the value in the Custom Feerate field all the way down to the node's configured minimum relay fee.\r\n-   In the Overview tab, the watch-only balance will be the only balance shown if the wallet was created using the\u00a0`createwallet`\u00a0RPC and the\u00a0`disable_private_keys`\u00a0parameter was set to true.\r\n-   The launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS if compiled with macosx min version greater than 10.11 (use CXXFLAGS=\"-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\" CFLAGS=\"-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\" for setting the deployment sdk version)\r\n\r\nTools\r\n=====\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`litecoin-wallet`\u00a0tool is now distributed alongside Litecoin Core's other executables. Without needing to use any RPCs, this tool can currently create a new wallet file or display some basic information about an existing wallet, such as whether the wallet is encrypted, whether it uses an HD seed, how many transactions it contains, and how many address book entries it has.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis section describes planned changes to Litecoin Core that may affect other Litecoin software and services.\r\n\r\n-   Since version 0.16.0, Litecoin Core's built-in wallet has defaulted to generating P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses when users want to receive payments. These addresses are backwards compatible with all widely-used software. Starting with Litecoin Core 0.20, Litecoin Core will default to native segwit addresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other benefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending to bech32 addresses, and if the Litecoin Core project sees enough additional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving addresses in Litecoin Core 0.20. P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses will continue to be provided if the user requests them in the GUI or by RPC, and anyone who doesn't want the update will be able to configure their default address type. (Similarly, pioneering users who want to change their default now may set the\u00a0`addresstype=bech32`\u00a0configuration option in any Litecoin Core release from 0.16.0 up.)\r\n\r\nDeprecated P2P messages\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n-   BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated. Reject messages have no use case on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most network nodes. Furthermore, they increase bandwidth and can be harmful for privacy and security. It has been possible to disable BIP 61 messages since v0.17 with the\u00a0`-enablebip61=0`\u00a0option. BIP 61 messages will be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed entirely.\r\n\r\nLow-level changes\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis section describes RPC changes mainly useful for testing, mostly not relevant in production. The changes are mentioned for completeness.\r\n\r\nRPC\r\n===\r\n\r\n-   The\u00a0`submitblock`\u00a0RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block was invalid the first time it processed that block, but returned a generic \"duplicate\" rejection message on subsequent occasions it processed the same block. It now always returns the fundamental reason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \"duplicate\" for valid blocks it has already accepted.\r\n-   A new\u00a0`submitheader`\u00a0RPC allows submitting block headers independently from their block. This is likely only useful for testing.\r\n-   The\u00a0`signrawtransactionwithkey`\u00a0and\u00a0`signrawtransactionwithwallet`\u00a0RPCs have been modified so that they also optionally accept a\u00a0`witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output. This is compatible with the change to\u00a0`listunspent`.\r\n-   For the\u00a0`walletprocesspsbt`\u00a0and\u00a0`walletcreatefundedpsbt`\u00a0RPCs, if the\u00a0`bip32derivs`\u00a0parameter is set to true but the key metadata for a public key has not been updated yet, then that key will have a derivation path as if it were just an independent key (i.e. no derivation path and its master fingerprint is itself).\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   The\u00a0`-usehd`\u00a0configuration option was removed in version 0.16. From that version onwards, all new wallets created are hierarchical deterministic wallets. This release makes specifying\u00a0`-usehd`\u00a0an invalid configuration option.\r\n\r\nNetwork\r\n=======\r\n\r\n-   This release allows peers that your node automatically disconnected for misbehavior (e.g. sending invalid data) to reconnect to your node if you have unused incoming connection slots. If your slots fill up, a misbehaving node will be disconnected to make room for nodes without a history of problems (unless the misbehaving node helps your node in some other way, such as by connecting to a part of the Internet from which you don't have many other peers). Previously, Litecoin Core banned the IP addresses of misbehaving peers for a period of time (default of 1 day); this was easily circumvented by attackers with multiple IP addresses. If you manually ban a peer, such as by using the\u00a0`setban`\u00a0RPC, all connections from that peer will still be rejected.\r\n\r\nWallet\r\n======\r\n\r\n-   The key metadata will need to be upgraded the first time that the HD seed is available. For unencrypted wallets this will occur on wallet loading. For encrypted wallets this will occur the first time the wallet is unlocked.\r\n-   Newly encrypted wallets will no longer require restarting the software. Instead such wallets will be completely unloaded and reloaded to achieve the same effect.\r\n-   A sub-project of Litecoin Core now provides Hardware Wallet Interaction (HWI) scripts that allow command-line users to use several popular hardware key management devices with Litecoin Core. See their\u00a0[project page](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI#readme)\u00a0for details.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n========\r\n\r\n-   This release changes the Random Number Generator (RNG) used from OpenSSL to Litecoin Core's own implementation, although entropy gathered by Litecoin Core is fed out to OpenSSL and then read back in when the program needs strong randomness. This moves Litecoin Core a little closer to no longer needing to depend on OpenSSL, a dependency that has caused security issues in the past. The new implementation gathers entropy from multiple sources, including from hardware supporting the rdseed CPU instruction.\r\n\r\nChanges for particular platforms\r\n================================\r\n\r\n-   On macOS, Litecoin Core now opts out of application CPU throttling (\"app nap\") during initial blockchain download, when catching up from over 100 blocks behind the current chain tip, or when reindexing chain data. This helps prevent these operations from taking an excessively long time because the operating system is attempting to conserve power.\r\n\r\nDownload Binaries\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTo download, please visit the download page\u00a0[here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder\u00a0[here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.18.1/).\r\n\r\nPlease use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries. This ensures that the binary you have downloaded has not been tampered with. Linux, MacOS and Win32 cygwin command line GPG instructions are available\u00a0[here](https://download.litecoin.org/README-HOWTO-GPG-VERIFY-TEAM-MEMBERS-KEY.txt). Please also note that we GPG sign the binaries as a convenience to you, the ultimate way to verify the integrity of the builds is to build them yourself using Gitian.

All governance votes will utilize on-chain voting.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n* Adjustment of the event contract address record generated within smart contracts which modifies the binary hex of the smart contract address in topic.\r\n* Security upgrade of the mainnet pertaining to modifications of the blacklist management via smart contract.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-03-29T13:15:39Z", "project": "Nebulas (NAS)", "currency": "nas", "alias": "nebulas", "repo": "nebulasio/go-nebulas", "type": "nebulas", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.nebulas.io", "doc": "https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas#building-from-docker", "api": "https://wiki.nebulas.io/en/latest/go-nebulas/tutorials/05-interacting-with-nebulas-by-rpc-api.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.1.2.2_test", "html_url": "https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/cocos-mainnet/releases/tag/v1.1.2.2_test", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/cocos-mainnet", "body": "bug fixes\uff1a\r\nfix bug of call contract fee share operation.   \r\nadd functions:\r\n1.multiplatform compile support.\r\n2.add quit command in cli_wallet.\r\n3.add test modules.", "created_at": "2020-03-05T10:15:44Z", "project": "Cocos-BCX (COCOS)", "currency": "cocos", "alias": "cocos", "repo": "Cocos-BCX/cocos-mainnet", "type": "cocos", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://www.cocosabc.com", "doc": "https://cocosbcx.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/mainnet/node.html", "api": "https://cocosbcx.readthedocs.io/projects/devcocosbcx/zh_CN/latest/mainnet/API.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Beta3.0.3", "tag_name": "Beta3.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/HcashOrg/hcOMNI/releases/tag/Beta3.0.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/HcashOrg/hcOMNI", "body": "", "created_at": "2020-02-17T04:49:18Z", "project": "hcOMNI (hcOMNI)", "currency": "hcomni", "alias": "hcomni", "repo": "HcashOrg/hcOMNI", "type": "hc", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://hcomni-explorer.h.cash", "doc": "https://github.com/HcashOrg/hcOMNI/blob/master/README.md", "api": "https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#json-rpc-api", "add_time": "2020-03-27T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Mainnet v1.1", "tag_name": "v1.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/stegos/stegos/releases/tag/v1.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/stegos/stegos", "body": "This is a hotfix release for [Mainnet v1.0](https://github.com/stegos/stegos/releases/tag/v1.0). \r\n**Upgrading to Hotfix 1 is highly recommended.**\r\n\r\n### Changes since [Mainnet v1.0](https://github.com/stegos/stegos/releases/tag/v1.0):\r\n\r\n- Added `stake all` command, for staking all available payment utxos.\r\n- Implemented resending of restake transacitons, that increase node resilience.\r\n- Improved logs, remove downgraded technical errors to info.\r\n- Added `show validators` command to show current active validators group.\r\n- Fix panic in snowball.\r\n- Add `accounts_info` as an alias for `list_accounts`\r\n- Implemented API call to get list of connected nodes.\r\n- Make payment always use fixed fee for two outputs.\r\n- Refactored transaction tracking.\r\n- Clarifies error messages.\r\n- Updated AES crate, and fixed a bug that cause a panic on system that support AES-NI instruction set, but didn't support AVX2.\r\n- Fixed panic on unseal created account at single epoch.\r\n- Removed virtual public addresses from CLI.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nSee [https://docs.stegos.com](https://docs.stegos.com)\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease join us on [Telegram Chat](https://t.me/stegos4privacy) to let us know your thoughts.
