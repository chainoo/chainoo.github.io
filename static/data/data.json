This behaviour could be disabled by setting the config option `-nooptimize-getheaders`.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that these redundant requests were masking an unrelated bug in the chain-rewinding logic that is used when the node detects a change to the consensus rules (for example, if a user forgets to upgrade their `zcashd` node before a network upgrade activates, and temporarily follows an un-upgraded chain before restarting with the latest version).\r\n\r\nIn certain uncommon scenarios, a node could end up in a situation where it would believe that the best header it knew about was more than 160 blocks behind its actual best-known block. The redundant `getheaders` requests meant that this did not cause an issue, because the node would continue requesting headers until it found new blocks. After the `getheaders` optimizations, if a peer returned a `headers` message that was entirely known to the node, it would stop requesting more headers from that peer; this eventually caused node synchronization to stall. Restarting with the `-nooptimize-getheaders` config option would enable the node to continue syncing.\r\n\r\nThis release fixes the bug at its source, but the `-nooptimize-getheaders` config option remains available if necessary.\r\n\r\nBuild system changes\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- Cross-compilation support for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and 32-bit Windows binaries, has been removed.

Such transactions saturate network links and fill up blocks much quicker. Users are expected to submit v2 transactions to upload data.\r\n- Orphaned transactions are returned to the mempool now. Very roughly, about 0.5% of all submitted transactions used to be dropped from the weave after a reorg. The measure will eliminate almost all of such cases.\r\n- A bug is fixed where the peer list update may get stuck (the `ar_bridge_update_peers_process_is_stuck` log).\r\n- A bug is fixed where the node may store and report as synced but not serve some chunks after shutdown.\r\n- A bug is fixed where a node might lose a chunk after a chain reorg.\r\n\r\n**Upgrade instructions**\r\n\r\nN.2.4.2.0 comes with the prebuilt binaries for the Linux and Darwin x86_64 platforms.\r\n\r\nDownload the corresponding archive and unpack it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntar -xzf arweave-2.4.2.0.linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to unpack it inside a dedicated directory. You can always move this directory around, but the miner may not work if you move only some of the files. The weave data would, by default, be stored in this directory, too, but it can be overridden using the data_dir command-line argument.\r\nThe archive contents look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/  data/  erts-10.3/  lib/  releases/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run the miner, execute ./bin/start <arguments>. See the mining guide for more details.\r\n\r\nIf your OS/platform architecture is not in the list, check README for how to build the miner from sources.\r\n\r\nIf you want to run the miner from the existing Git folder, upgrade Erlang to version 23 and execute the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit fetch --all --tags && git checkout -f N.2.4.2.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now run the miner using the arweave-server script.\r\n\r\n**Support**\r\n\r\nFor more details on how to run a mining node, please see our mining guide - https://docs.arweave.org/info/mining/mining-guide.

All invoked functions are executed within a single Invoke Script transaction. The total complexity is limited. [More about dApp-to-dApp invocation](/en/ride/advanced/dapp-to-dapp)\r\n* Amended [Invoke Script transaction](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/transaction-type/invoke-script-transaction):\r\n   * Canceled the extra fee of 0.004 WAVES for smart assets in payments and script actions.\r\n   * Transaction can contain up to 10 attached payments.\r\n   * The total complexity for all callable functions and asset scripts involved is limited by 26,000 (the sender's account script complexity is not included in this limit). \r\n   * The maximum complexity of a callable function of a dApp script is changed to 10,000.\r\n* For all types of transactions, canceled the extra fee of 0.004 WAVES for sending a transaction from a smart account or dApp unless the complexity of sender's account script or dApp script verifier function exceeds 200.\r\n\r\n### Ride\r\n\r\n* Issued [version 5](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/) of the Ride [Standard library](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/script/standard-library).\r\n* Enabled processing up to 10 payments attached to the Invoke Script transaction.\r\n* Added the functions for dApp-to-dApp invocation:\r\n   * [invoke](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/dapp-to-dapp#invoke)\r\n   * [reentrantInvoke](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/dapp-to-dapp#reentrantinvoke)\r\n* Added [strict variables](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/variables/) that are evaluated before the next expression to ensure executing callable functions and applying their actions in the right order.\r\n* Modified the [callable function result](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/callable-function#invocation-result) by adding a return value.\r\n* Modified the [Invocation](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/structures/common-structures/invocation) structure: in case of dApp-to-dApp invocation, the structure contains the address and public key of both the sender of the Invoke Script transaction and the dApp account that invokes the callable function.\r\n* The maximum total number of `Issue`, `Reissue`, `Burn`, `SponsorFee`, `ScriptTransfer`, `Lease`, `LeaseCancel` script actions executed by all callable functions in a single transaction is 30.\r\n* The maximum total number of `BinaryEntry`, `BooleanEntry`, `IntegerEntry`, `StringEntry`, `DeleteEntry` script actions executed by all callable functions in a single transaction is 100.\r\n* Added script actions that the callable function can perform:\r\n   * [Lease](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/structures/script-actions/lease) \u2014 leases WAVES.\r\n   * [LeaseCancel](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/structures/script-actions/lease-cancel) \u2014 cancels a specified lease.\r\n\r\n   Using these actions, you can change the amount of the lease, in particular, withdraw a part of the leased funds. If you cancel a lease for a larger amount and create a new lease for a smaller amount with the same recipient in the same script invocation, the recipient's generating balance decreases by the difference. Otherwise, if you send two separate transactions: a Lease Cancel transaction and a Lease transaction, they can be added to a different blocks and therefore generating balance decreases by the amount of the canceled lease immediately and increases by the amount of the new lease after 1000 blocks.\r\n\r\n* Added the function [calculateLeaseId](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/blockchain-functions#calculateleaseid) that calculates ID of the lease formed by the `Lease` structure.\r\n* Added an arbitrary data type \u2014 [Any](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/data-types/any).\r\n* Added the [BigInt](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/data-types/bigint) data type of 64 bytes (512 bits) and functions.\r\n* Added the following built-in functions:\r\n   * [isDataStorageUntouched](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/account-data-storage-functions#isdatastorageuntouched) that checks if the data storage of a given account never contained any entries.\r\n   * [scriptHash](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/blockchain-functions#scripthash) that returns [BLAKE2b-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_%28hash_function%29) hash of the script assigned to a given account.\r\n   * [fraction(Int, Int, Int, Union): Int](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/math-functions#fractionintround) that multiplies and divides integers to avoid overflow, applying the specified rounding method.\r\n* Added the following [account data storage functions](https://docs.waves.tech/en/ride/v5/functions/built-in-functions/account-data-storage-functions) that allow the dApp script to read entries of its own data storage:\r\n   * `getBinary(key: String): ByteVector|Unit`\r\n   * `getBinaryValue(key: String): ByteVector`\r\n   * `getBoolean(key: String): Boolean|Unit`\r\n   * `getBooleanValue(key: String): Boolean`\r\n   * `getInteger(key: String): Int|Unit`\r\n   * `getIntegerValue(key: String): Int`\r\n   * `getString(key: String): String|Unit`\r\n   * `getStringValue(key: String): String`\r\n* The maximum complexity of a callable function of a dApp script is changed to 10,000.\r\n\r\n## Node REST API\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nA lease can be created both as a result of a Lease transaction and as a result of an Invoke Script transaction via a `Lease` script action. Therefore, the response of the following endpoints has been changed:\r\n* In the response of `/transactions/address/{address}/limit/{limit}` and `/transactions/info/{id}` endpoints for a Lease Cancel transaction, the `lease` structure now contains lease parameters instead of Lease transaction fields.\r\n* `/leasing/active/{address}` returns an array of structures containing lease parameters instead of array of Lease transactions.\r\n\r\n### Semantic Changes\r\n\r\n* dApp-to-dApp invocation results are added as the `invokes` array to the `stateChanges` structure returned by the following endpoints:\r\n   * `/transactions/info/{id}`\r\n   * `/transactions/address/{address}/limit/{limit}`\r\n\r\n   Each element of `invokes` array, in turn,  also contains `stateChanges`.\r\n\r\n* Results of the `Lease` and `LeaseCancel` script actions are added to the `stateChanges` structure.\r\n* Results of `Lease` and `LeaseCancel` script actions are also added to the `trace` structure returned by the following endpoints:\r\n   * `/transactions/broadcast`\r\n   * `/debug/validate`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Added the `/leasing/info` endpoint that returns lease parameters by lease IDs.\r\n* Added the `/blocks/heightByTimestamp` endpoint that returns blockchain height at a given timestamp.\r\n\r\n## Activation\r\n\r\nTo activate the improvements listed above, vote for feature #16 \u201cRide V5, dApp-to-dApp invocations\u201d.\r\n\r\n## Update Notes\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Blockchain Updates extension, there's no need to reimport state when updating from version 1.2.x.\r\n**Attention Blockchain Updates users:** \r\n* Due to an issue with one of the previous versions, current extension data is likely inconsistent with the blockchain. Please reimport blockchain to rebuild BU state.\r\n* In some cases BU subscription can get stuck, that is once connected, the client receives some updates up to the most recent block/microblock, but won't receive any subsequent updates when node appends new blocks/microblocks. This is a known issue. While we are working on a fix, one possible workaround is to monitor the connection, and once the subscription is stuck, restart the node process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Official pools update notes\r\n\r\nDue to presense of breaking changes in the Node's API please migrate your existing projects/applications. Version 1.3.5 will be immediately available on the testnet. Mainnet will be updated on June, 11th.\r\n\r\n## SHA256 Checksums\r\n```\r\nb938cbd04016131be6a06a3f6db9d8fc5df8fe6fd1204469e1a67eeb999f1bbc  waves-all-1.3.5.jar\r\n76381331a983383ef4991077abcafcaed3f5ad55bb686c52dd0f1c68ca752d04  waves-grpc-server-1.3.5.tgz\r\n449af81db3ec693baaf5508ca5769587a7023ddaea203f406413efca6a2e840f  waves-grpc-server-stagenet_1.3.5_all.deb\r\naa801db4c4b279fc226b2642d11281cc02ec7f182668a96628e8bc097e0aadb8  waves-grpc-server-testnet_1.3.5_all.deb\r\n2c28f517df7595fd85e1a12a0dc78eb2e8cf3f7316251b160eeacf5f56dbabf0  waves-grpc-server_1.3.5_all.deb\r\nf4faf1da9fc23b90ba96f48585f73b4ac1a1127ec73fd636decac57261cca5fa  waves-stagenet_1.3.5_all.deb\r\n6dd05421d4f2622693acb8ca320af291c04aeb0052863b9bedf3c2dc79e167df  waves-testnet_1.3.5_all.deb\r\n142616a71ed1aa3f08623db036cb540234a546d2d6cbd769dbe605cced28abb4  waves_1.3.5_all.deb\r\n```", "created_at": "2021-06-03T12:23:55Z", "project": "Waves (WAVES)", "currency": "waves", "alias": "waves", "repo": "wavesplatform/Waves", "type": "waves", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://wavesexplorer.com", "doc": "https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node", "api": "https://nodes.wavesnodes.com/api-docs/index.html", "add_time": "2021-05-19T02:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Release 2.0.11.1.0", "tag_name": "2.0.11.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/releases/tag/2.0.11.1.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain", "body": "This software update is our monthly release.

If one output is below the threshold, the transaction is rejected.\r\n\r\nExample: For a typical transaction with an output of 34 bytes in size, the formula yields a threshold of 135 Satoshis.\r\n\r\n    s = 34\r\n    d = 300\r\n    r = 250\r\n    m = 148\r\n\r\n    Threshold = (300 * (250 * (34 + 148)/1000)) / 100 = 135\r\n\r\nNote the same formula would give a threshold of 136.5 Satoshis if floating point arithmetic is used.\r\n\r\nA typical transaction output, with the default parameter settings in 1.0.8, needs to be worth 135\r\nSatoshis not to be considered dust. Note that due to rounding, the calculated dust threshold for the\r\nexample transaction becomes 0 if the *dustlimitfactor* and the *dustrelayfee* are very low.\r\n\r\n### Free consolidation transaction can be used to avoid dusting attack.\r\n\r\nTransaction validation has now been relaxed to allow a new kind of transaction, the dust return transaction.\r\nThis new transaction type allows donating dust to miners via fees as a new way to counter wallet dusting attacks.\r\nThis is more economical for the network because it allows clearing the wallets and UTXO databases from otherwise\r\npractically unspendable outputs, whilst completely removing the incentive to conduct dust attacks at all.\r\n\r\nA transaction is considered a dust return transaction if the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n- The transaction has a single output of zero value (zero amount).\r\n- The scriptPubKey is as follows:\r\n\r\n        OP_FALSE OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA \u2018dust\u2019.\r\n\r\nAll inputs must be standard inputs or the following node configuration parameter must be set:\r\n\r\n    -acceptnonstdconsolidationinput=1\r\n\r\nThe node must also be configured to accept non standard transactions. I.e. following configuration option must be set:\r\n\r\n    -acceptnonstdtx=1\r\n\r\nNote that dust return transactions share two configuration parameters with consolidation transactions:\r\n\r\n- *-acceptnonstdconsolidationinput* (default: 0)\r\n- *-minconsolidationfactor* (default: 20. Setting consolidation factor to 0 disables consolidation transactions and dust return transactions as well)\r\n", "created_at": "2021-05-24T09:17:01Z", "project": "Bitcoin SV (BSV)", "currency": "bsv", "alias": "bitcoin-sv", "repo": "bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.viawallet.com/bsv", "doc": "https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv", "api": "https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "v1.2.0", "tag_name": "v1.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node", "body": "Key Changes:\r\n - Created REST endpoint for OpenRPC schema.\r\n - More consensus and block proposer log messages added.\r\n - Era supervisors must access, only deploy hashes, which will be stored separately from block bodies.\r\n - Networking component instrumentation to gain more insight into the network before making any changes.\r\n - Block Validator now distinguishes between deploys and transfers.\r\n - Configurable delay added before proposing deploys.\r\n - Added last emergency_restart field to chainspec.\r\n - From Config broadcast_channel_size removed.\r\n - Quantstamp Audit changes Part 1.\r\n - Default deploy TTL reduced to 30mins.\r\n\r\nKnown Issue:\r\n - After an upgrade the era metric is set to 0.

When activated, this feature provides a way to get return values which are strongly committed to in block headers from actions into external processes without having to rely on get_table or using the debug console via print statements. This allows smart contract developers to be able to process the return value from an action directly, further streamlining the smart contract development process. An example can be seen [here.](https://github.com/EOSIO/return-values-example-app)\r\n\r\n### Configurable WASM Limits ([#8360](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/8360))\r\nNew protocol feature: `CONFIGURABLE_WASM_LIMITS`. When activated, this feature allows privileged contracts to set the constraints on WebAssembly code.\r\n\r\n### Extensible Blockchain Parameters ([#9402](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9402))\r\nThe basic means of manipulating consensus parameters for an EOSIO blockchain has been a pair of intrinsic functions: `get_blockchain_parameters_packed` and `set_blockchain_parameters_packed`.  These intrinsics are tied to a specific and inflexible definition of blockchain parameters and include no convenient means to _version_ the set of parameters; which is an inconvenience to add/remove/modify in future consensus upgrades.\r\n\r\nTo alleviate this, Nodeos now has a new protocol feature: `BLOCKCHAIN_PARAMETERS`. When activated, this protocol feature is intended to eventually supplant the existing intrinsics and provide greater flexibility for future consensus upgrades. When activated it will allow contracts to link to the new intrinsics.\r\n\r\n### Health Logging For Nodeos running The State History Plugin ([#9208](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9208)) ([#9239](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9239)) ([#9277](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9277))\r\nNodeos now has added support for a separate logger to the state history plugin and includes some additional logging messages for receiving requests and sending replies. In addition, the trace and chain state log can now be split in the state history plugin as well.\r\n\r\n### Instrumentation Support for Nodeos ([#9631](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9631))\r\nNodeos now supports integration with Zipkin, an open source distributed tracing system.  This will enable system administrators to optimize Nodeos execution for performance-critical applications.\r\n\r\n### Key Value Tables ([#8223](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/8223), [#9298](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9298))\r\nNew protocol feature: `KV_DATABASE`. When activated, this feature provides a Key Value API. This new API is a more flexible, simplified way for developers to create and search on-chain tables. Developers can also modify the table structure after it has been created, which is currently impossible with multi-index tables.\r\n\r\nDevelopers will also be able to split up tables they have already written. An example is the case where the developer has a table that stores a user\u2019s first and last name along with other information. The developer could now decide to split the original table into two separate tables, one containing the first names and one containing the last names.\r\n\r\nAs with the existing db api, contracts can flexibly specify which authorizing account provides the RAM resources for this data.\r\n\r\nA new data type in EOSIO.CDT v1.8.0 called `eosio::kv::map` provides the underlying functionality and should be used in contracts over the type called `eosio::kv::table` that is currently in a developer preview state.\r\n\r\nAn example can be seen [here.](https://github.com/EOSIO/key-value-example-app) You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/tree/develop/contracts/enable-kv) to quickly create a test chain with Key Value support.\r\n\r\n### Prune Context-Free Data ([#9061](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9061))\r\nFrom inception, EOSIO has supported the concept of Context-Free Data, or data that may be removed without affecting the integrity of the chain. This release includes functionality that is designed to allow administrators to designate specific data as Context-Free and subsequently remove, or prune, that data from the blockchain while maintaining system stability.\r\n\r\nOnce this data has been pruned, full validation is no longer possible, only light validation, which requires implicit trust in the block producers. Due to this factor, the Prune Context-Free Data feature is only suitable for a private blockchain as part a larger privacy, security, or regulatory compliance solution.\r\n\r\n### Support For Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 7.x, and CentOS 8 ([#9332](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9332)) ([#9475](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9475))\r\nEOSIO now supports Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 7.x, and CentOS 8, in addition to previous releases supporting Amazon Linux 2, CentOS 7, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, MacOS 10.14 (Mojave), MacOS 10.15 (Catalina).\r\n\r\n### Reimplement Chainbase Using Intrusive Instead of multi_index ([#58](https://github.com/EOSIO/chainbase/pull/58))\r\nNodoes now features an upgraded version of chainbase using intrusive instead of multi_index. This makes chainbase more performant and features per container memory pools, full exception safety, lighter weight representation of the undo stack, and avl trees instead of rb trees.\r\n\r\n### [Developer Preview] Blockvault ([#9705](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9705))\r\nNodeos now supports clustering for the block producer node, enabling blockchain administrators to implement industry standard disaster recovery architectures. Two or more nodes may be deployed as a single logical producer. If the primary node goes down, a system properly configured to leverage this solution can attain similar data recovery guarantees to that of industry leading database and cloud services, with minimal service disruption.\r\n\r\nWhile this feature increases resiliency for block production on public networks, it also provides particular value for private chains running with a single logical producer. Single-producer chains can use it to provide immediate finality with tools to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure.\r\n\r\nTo use this feature, `nodeos` must be configured as a producer with the appropriate `--block-vault-backend` option specified.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnodeos --plugin eosio::producer_plugin --producer-name myproducera --plugin eosio::blockvault_client_plugin --block-vault-backend postgresql://user:password@mycompany.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information on using this feature please see the `README.md` file in directory `~/eos/plugins/blockvault_client_plugin/README.md`.\r\n\r\nThis feature is being released as a \"developer preview\" and is not yet ready for production usage. We look forward to community feedback to further develop and harden this feature.\r\n\r\n### [Developer Preview] RocksDB Storage for DB and Key Value APIs ([#9340](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9340)) ([#9529](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/pull/9529))\r\nRocksDB is now supported as a storage option behind both the DB and Key Value APIs. This gives blockchain system administrators the flexibility to choose between RAM or RocksDB to optimize Nodeos performance for their workloads.\r\n\r\nTo use this feature, `nodeos` must specify which backing store to use by passing the flag `--backing-store=rocksdb`.\r\n\r\nFor more information on using this feature please see the `10_how-to-configure-state-storage.md` file in directory `~/eos/docs/01_nodeos/02_usage/60_how-to-guides/10_how-to-configure-state-storage.md`.\r\n\r\nThis feature is being released as a \"developer preview\" and is not yet ready for production usage. We look forward to community feedback to further develop and harden this feature.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading from previous versions of EOSIO\r\n\r\n### Upgrading From v2.0.x\r\n\r\nNode operators running version v2.0.x should be able to upgrade to v2.1.0 using a snapshot. In addition, moving from a chainbase-backed node to a RocksDB-backed node or the reverse will also require a snapshot to migrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n-

This release protects against the security issue CVE-2021-3499 affecting OpenSSL, adds an amendment to fix an issue with small offers not being properly removed from order books in some cases, and includes various other minor fixes. Version 1.7.2 supersedes version 1.7.1 and adds fixes for more issues that were discovered during the release cycle.\r\n\r\n## Action Required\r\nThis release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol: fixRmSmallIncreasedQOffers. This amendment is now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's amendment process, which enables protocol changes following two weeks of >80% support from trusted validators. If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.7.2 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network. If you operate an XRP Ledger validator, please learn more about this amendment so you can make informed decisions about how your validator votes. If you take no action, your validator begins voting in favor of any new amendments as soon as it has been upgraded.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n**fixRmSmallIncreasedQOffers Amendment**: This amendment fixes an issue where certain small offers can be left at the tip of an order book without being consumed or removed when appropriate and causes some payments and Offers to fail when they should have succeeded (#3827).\r\n**Adjust OpenSSL defaults and mitigate CVE-2021-3499**: Prior to this fix, servers compiled against a vulnerable version of OpenSSL could have a crash triggered by a malicious network connection. This fix disables renegotiation support in OpenSSL so that the rippled server is not vulnerable to this bug regardless of the OpenSSL version used to compile the server. This also removes support for deprecated TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 and ciphers that are not part of TLS 1.2 (#79e69da).\r\n**Support HTTP health check-in reporting mode**: Enables the Health Check special method when running the server in the new Reporting Mode introduced in 1.7.0 (9c8cadd).\r\n**Maintain compatibility for forwarded RPC responses**: Fixes a case in API responses from servers in Reporting Mode, where requests that were forwarded to a P2P-mode server would have the result field nested inside another result field (8579eb0).\r\n**Add load_factor in reporting mode**: Adds a load_factor value to the server info method response when running the server in Reporting Mode so that the response is compatible with the format returned by servers in P2P mode (the default) (430802c).\r\n**Properly encode metadata from tx RPC command**: Fixes a problem where transaction metadata in the tx API method response would be in JSON format even when the binary was requested (7311629).\r\n**Updates to Windows builds**: When building on Windows, use vcpkg 2021 by default and add compatibility with MSVC 2019 (36fe196), (30fd458).", "created_at": "2021-05-19T19:22:03Z", "project": "Ripple (XRP)", "currency": "xrp", "alias": "ripple", "repo": "ripple/rippled", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://xrpscan.com", "doc": "https://xrpl.org/install-rippled-on-ubuntu.html", "api": "https://xrpl.org/rippled-api.html", "add_time": "2019-12-20T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Release v1.6.2", "tag_name": "v1.6.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn/releases/tag/v1.6.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn", "body": "# v1.6.2 Release Notes\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n- Fixed that prefetch logic leaks CPU usage.

StackTrie methods previously took ownership of key/value byte slices passed to it, which was unintuitive for calling code ([#22673](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22673), [#22686](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22686), [#22685](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22685))\r\n\r\n#### RPC/GraphQL API changes\r\n\r\n- The gas price oracle deals much better with blocks containing transactions of very low price. Such transactions are typically generated by miners using MEV techniques ([#22722](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22722))\r\n- `eth_hashrate` works again ([#22765](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22765))\r\n- `debug_traceCall` now supports state overrides like `eth_call` ([#22245](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22245))\r\n- EVM Tracing now reports correct gas costs for EIP-2929 state access ([#22702](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22702))\r\n- Clef and the external signer account backend now support signing of EIP-2930 access list transactions ([#22585](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22585))\r\n\r\n#### Networking\r\n\r\n- Support for eth/64 has been removed. The minimum protocol version is now eth/65 ([#22636](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22636))\r\n- The core of snap sync has been re-architected to allow for dynamic request sizes ([#22668](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22668), [#22777](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22777))\r\n- Several other correctness issues in the snap sync client are resolved ([#22678](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22678), [#22789](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22789), [#22760](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22760), [#22762](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22762), [#22761](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22761))\r\n- DNS discovery for the snap protocol now uses the eth protocol node list. The snap-specific node list will be retired later. This is possible because more than 75% of all eth nodes support serving snap ([#22808](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22808))\r\n- For eth and snap, the protocol handlers now report additional metrics about response latency ([#22608](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22608), [#22751](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22751), [#22753](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22753)). A Grafana dashboard incorporating the new metrics is available [here](https://gist.github.com/karalabe/1e26f9ea5c842fb118584edadc454e18).\r\n- Several new tests have been added in the cross-client eth protocol test suite. The tests are now more reliable and run as part of pull request CI on Travis ([#22698](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22698), [#22630](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22630), [#22757](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22757), [#22749](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22749), [#22754](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22754), [#22801](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22801))\r\n- The discv5 message handler now reflects IPv4-in-IPv6 addresses correctly when handling PING ([#22703](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22703))\r\n- The DNS node list tools in cmd/devp2p now support setting a size limit for node lists. This was added because the list of mainnet snap protocol nodes overflowed our AWS Route53 account ([#22694](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22694), [#22695](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22695))\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\n\r\n- The Windows build environment has been cleaned up and updated to use GCC 10 ([#22811](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22811), [#22788](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22788), [#22804](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22804), [#22821](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22821))\r\n- The crypto/bn256 and crypto/bls12381 packages are now fuzz-tested against gnark-crypto ([#22755](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22755))\r\n- go-ethereum now builds correctly on OpenBSD/arm64 ([#22693](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/22693))\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.10.3 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/115?closed=1).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs with all our previous releases, you can find the:\r\n\r\n- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).\r\n- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/client-go).\r\n- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).\r\n", "created_at": "2021-05-05T11:20:06Z", "project": "Ethereum (ETH)", "currency": "eth", "alias": "ethereum", "repo": "ethereum/go-ethereum", "type": "ethereum", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://cn.etherscan.com", "doc": "https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth#install-on-ubuntu-via-ppas", "api": "https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Not Found", "tag_name": "", "html_url": "https://github.com/hoosmartchain/hoo-smartchain", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hoosmartchain/hoo-smartchain", "body": "", "created_at": "2021-04-30T08:00:00Z", "project": "Hoo Smart Chain (HSC)", "currency": "hsc", "alias": "hsc", "repo": "hoosmartchain/hoo-smartchain", "type": "eth", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://www.hscscan.com", "doc": "https://docs.hoosmartchain.com/#/dev/install", "api": "https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/api", "add_time": "2021-04-30T08:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Bitcoin Core 0.21.1", "tag_name": "v0.21.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.21.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin", "body": "Bitcoin Core version 0.21.1 is now available from:\r\n\r\nhttps://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.21.1/\r\n\r\nFor the release notes please see the git repository:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.21.1.md\r\n\r\nPreferably use the above download link, not the links provided by GitHub to download the source tarball, as the release tarballs are generated deterministically whereas GitHub's are not.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-04-29T19:41:07Z", "project": "Bitcoin (BTC)", "currency": "btc", "alias": "bitcoin", "repo": "bitcoin/bitcoin", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.viawallet.com/btc", "explorer1": "https://btc.com", "explorer2": "https://blockchair.com/bitcoin", "explorer3": "https://blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/zh/chain/bitcoin", "explorer4": "https://sochain.com", "doc": "https://github.com/4ops/docker-bitcoin-core", "api": "https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Chainweb Mainnet 2.7", "tag_name": "2.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/releases/tag/2.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node", "body": "This version replaces all previous versions.

(#1174)\r\n    *   Re-add builtin bootstrap nodes. This also means that default bootstrap nodes will  be used as long as `--ignore-boostrap-nodes` (or the respective configuration file setting) is not enabled.\r\n    *   Add `X-Peer-Addr` response header that allows nodes to auto-discover their external network configuration.\r\n    *   Enable chainweb-node to auto-configure the hostname when the hostname is set to '0.0.0.0'. This eliminates the need to use a (centralized) third party service for that.\r\n    *   Validate P2P configuration on startup.\r\n    *   Validate peer configuration on startup.\r\n    *   Check that a chainweb-node can connect with a configurable portion of the known-peers and bootstrap nodes at startup. The portion can be configured via the `--bootstrap-reachability` option or the `chainweb.p2p.bootstrapReachability` setting. The value is a number between 0 and 1. If it is 0 the reachability test is disabled.\r\n\r\n*   Remove deprecated mining coordination code. (#1177)\r\n    *   Removes support for public mining.\r\n    *   Fix two race conditions in the mining API that may have slightly increased the number blocks that got orphaned before being included on the chain.\r\n\r\n*   Internal infrastructure to support bridging KDA to other networks (#1210)\r\n\r\n*   New OpenAPI 3.0 specification of the chainweb-node API. The API documentation is maintained in the git repository https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-openapi. It is published at https://api.chainweb.com/openapi.\r\n\r\nSee the [changelog](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#27-2021-04-29) for more information.\r\n\r\n### SHA256 Hashes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nd5abb5ff928702ab0af1b145af5d8fe5bd256c60e56cf32d1f1f26c31075f3b0  chainweb-2.7.ghc-8.10.4.ubuntu-18.04.a777484.tar.gz\r\n2d8566cfccd66454cb28c78d77373e9fc15ad8fbdbdb54bb0bbfe87b0e84e1f8  chainweb-2.7.ghc-8.10.4.ubuntu-20.04.a777484.tar.gz\r\nf452cddf2176852c06181a29263ce7c7559d14036887fd3ed8cb00191b1dfe2d  chainweb-2.7.ghc-8.10.4.macOS-latest.a777484.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Nix store paths:\r\n\r\nLinux: `/nix/store/mamfh0lg0xz22zpkr9hd4w92bsly8acp-chainweb-2.7`\r\nMac: `/nix/store/qr03ni6d5z9xv7cx3mnfwba8vizfz14k-chainweb-2.7`\r\n\r\n### Docker:\r\n\r\n[End-user image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kadena/chainweb-node): `docker pull kadena/chainweb-node:2.7`\r\n[Binary-only Ubuntu-20.04](https://github.com/orgs/kadena-io/packages/container/package/chainweb-node%2Fubuntu): `docker pull ghcr.io/kadena-io/chainweb-node/ubuntu:2.7`\r\n[Binary-only Alpine](https://github.com/orgs/kadena-io/packages/container/package/chainweb-node%2Falpine): `docker pull ghcr.io/kadena-io/chainweb-node/alpine:2.7`", "created_at": "2021-04-28T23:06:08Z", "project": "Kadena (KDA)", "currency": "kda", "alias": "kadena", "repo": "kadena-io/chainweb-node", "type": "polkadot", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.chainweb.com/mainnet", "doc": "https://medium.com/kadenacoin/how-to-operate-a-kadena-node-kda-7844622ed5b4", "api": "https://kadena-io.github.io/kadena-docs/rest-api-examples", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "v0.10.0", "tag_name": "v0.10.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia/releases/tag/v0.10.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia", "body": "\r\n### Darwinia 0.10.0\r\n|  Chain   | Runtime Spec Version |\r\n| :------: | :------------------: |\r\n| Darwinia |          24          |\r\n|   Crab   |          43          |\r\n\r\n### \u26a0\ufe0f WARNING \u8b66\u544a\r\nThere're some DB migrations in the client side.

This comes with a significant number of changes. In this version recovering from a hard shutdown or crash was also greatly improved.\r\n\r\nWhile this release is not mandatory and doesn't change the consensus rules of the Omni Layer protocol, an upgrade is nevertheless recommended.\r\n\r\n**Due to the upgrade from Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 to 0.20.1, this version incooperates many changes, so please take your time to read through all release notes carefully.**\r\n\r\nUpgrading from 0.9.0, 0.8.2, 0.8.1 or 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/issues\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of contents\r\n=================\r\n\r\n- [Omni Core v0.10.0](#omni-core-v082)\r\n- [Upgrading and downgrading](#upgrading-and-downgrading)\r\n  - [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade)\r\n  - [Downgrading](#downgrading)\r\n  - [Compatibility with Bitcoin Core](#compatibility-with-bitcoin-core)\r\n- [Improvements](#improvements)\r\n  - [Built on top of Bitcoin Core 0.20.1](#built-on-top-of-bitcoin-core-0201)\r\n  - [Improved coin selection, when sending Omni Layer transactions](#improved-coin-selection-when-sending-omni-layer-transactions)\r\n  - [Better recovery from hard shutdowns or crashes](#better-recovery-from-hard-shutdowns-or-crashes)\r\n  - [Additional testing](#additional-testing)\r\n- [Change log](#change-log)\r\n- [Credits](#credits)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrading and downgrading\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nHow to upgrade\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIf you are running Bitcoin Core or an older version of Omni Core, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down, then copy the new version of `omnicored`, `omnicore-cli` and `omnicore-qt`. On Microsoft Windows the setup routine can be used to automate these steps.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0, the database of Omni Core is reconstructed, which can easily consume several hours. During the first startup historical Omni Layer transactions are reprocessed and Omni Core will not be usable for several hours up to more than a day. The progress of the initial scan is reported on the console, the GUI and written to the `debug.log`. The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.\r\n\r\nUpgrading from 0.9.0, 0.8.2, 0.8.1 or 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.\r\n\r\nDowngrading\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nDowngrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.\r\n\r\nCompatibility with Bitcoin Core\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nOmni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.20.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n============\r\n\r\nBuilt on top of Bitcoin Core 0.20.1\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe underlying base of Omni Core was upgraded from Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 to Bitcoin Core 0.20.1.\r\n\r\nPlease read the following release notes for further details very carefully:\r\n\r\n- [Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.19.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.20.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.19.0.1.md)\r\n- [Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.19.1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.20.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.19.1.md)\r\n- [Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.20.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.20.0/doc/release-notes.md)\r\n- [Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.20.1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.20.1/doc/release-notes.md)\r\n\r\n\r\nImproved coin selection, when sending Omni Layer transactions\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen creating and sending Omni Layer transactions, a certain transaction fee must be paid in Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nDuring transaction creation, the amount of fee needed is estimated. In the past, this estimation was rather genereous, resulting in a failure during transaction creation, even when enough Bitcoin were available to create a transaction. In this release, the fee estimation was optimized.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter recovery from hard shutdowns or crashes\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter a hard shutdown, kill or crash, Omni Core sometimes lost it's database, because it was not properly saved and became corrupted. Restoring from an old state was not possible, which resulted in a very time consuming process of reparsing old transactions.\r\n\r\nWith this release, Omni Core is able to properly recover from an older state, without the need of a very time consuming reprocessing of old transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional testing\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nMore tests were added to Omni Core.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange log\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThe following list includes relevant pull requests merged into this release:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- #1186 Bitcoin 0.20.1\r\n- #1191 [tests] check free DEx behaviour against DEx spec\r\n- #1193 Omni overview updates\r\n- #1194 Add Free DEx and fee cache tests\r\n- #1197 Integrate Bitcoin Core 0.20 patches\r\n- #1198 Additional changes missing from 0.20 merge\r\n- #1199 Qt disable wallet change in main window\r\n- #1200 Update version to 0.9.99 to indicate development\r\n- #1201 Reduce amount selected for use in transactions\r\n- #1210 cli tool: add Content-Type application/json\r\n- #1213 If watermark not in block index load from state files\r\n- #1214 Bump version and tests to 0.10\r\n- #1215 Add release notes for Omni Core 0.10\r\n- #1219 Trim Gitian build targets\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this release, especially to Peter Bushnell.", "created_at": "2021-04-08T17:34:41Z", "project": "Omni (OMNI)", "currency": "usdt", "alias": "omni", "repo": "OmniLayer/omnicore", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://www.omniexplorer.info", "doc": "https://github.com/mpugach/docker_omnicored", "api": "https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Oxygen Orion, Major Point Release 2", "tag_name": "v0.17.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.17.2.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/monero-project/monero", "body": "# Overview\r\n\r\nThis is the v0.17.2.0 point release of the Monero software.

When a block is received and during rescans of the locally stored blockchain, the checks are still performed.\r\n\r\nReduce default mempool expiry time\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nReduces the default time that transactions are cached in the mempool from 336 hours to 24 hours. This default setting can be overridden with the `-mempoolexpiry` parameter by individual node operators to a value (expressed in hours) that makes the most sense for the use cases the node serves.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Increase block download timeouts\r\n* Add size_on_disk, prune_target_size, automatic_pruning to getblockchaininfo\r\n* Add query options to listunspent RPC call\r\n* Set BIP65 softfork heights in chainparams.cpp.\r\n* Update package links for OSX cross compilation.\r\n* Change IPC prefix from `bitcoin:` to `dogecoin:`.\r\n* Locale independent sorting.\r\n* Corrections to Italian translation.\r\n* Refresh main and test network checkpoints and seeds.\r\n* Do not print an error on connection timeouts through proxy.\r\n* Numerous fixes to automated tests.\r\n* Numerous fixes to documentation.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-28T17:39:36Z", "project": "Dogecoin (DOGE)", "currency": "doge", "alias": "dogecoin", "repo": "dogecoin/dogecoin", "type": "utxo", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://explorer.viawallet.com/doge", "explorer1": "https://sochain.com/doge", "doc": "https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin", "api": "https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "Release v2.0.9", "tag_name": "v2.0.9", "html_url": "https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX/releases/tag/v2.0.9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX", "body": "\r\nUpgrade priority:\r\n\r\n- [x] **Medium** (upgrade at your earliest convenience)\r\n- [ ] **High** (upgrade ASAP)\r\n\r\nWASM runtime built with [srtool](https://hub.docker.com/r/chainxorg/srtool) using `rustc 1.48.0-nightly (381b445ff 2020-09-29)`.\r\n\r\nchainx runtime proposal hash: `0xa919dc70d5d3f61365065adf46ad67181424c537e79db4128fc378f39d9bb30d`.\r\n\r\nNative runtime version: **10**\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n##### Runtime\r\n\r\n- Integrate Proxy module (https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX/pull/478)\r\n\r\n##### Others\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-25T04:46:52Z", "project": "ChainX (PCX)", "currency": "pcx", "alias": "chainx", "repo": "chainx-org/ChainX", "type": "polkadot", "hosting": "github", "explorer": "https://chainx.subscan.io", "doc": "https://doc.chainx.org/#/zh-en/run-a-Chainx-node", "api": "https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX/wiki/RPC", "add_time": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"name": "RSK Papyrus Release v2.2.0", "tag_name": "PAPYRUS-2.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases/tag/PAPYRUS-2.2.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj", "body": "This release contains relevant improvements from community feedback.

This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.\r\n\r\nHow to Upgrade\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\u00a0`/Applications/Litecoin-Qt`\u00a0(on Mac) or\u00a0`litecoind`/`litecoin-qt`\u00a0(on Linux).\r\n\r\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\r\n\r\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported. However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them.\r\n\r\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than 10.10. Additionally, Litecoin Core does not yet change appearance when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n============\r\n\r\nWallet GUI\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and (2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control input selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when switching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended not to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.\r\n\r\nNotable changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nMining\r\n------\r\n\r\n-   Calls to\u00a0`getblocktemplate`\u00a0will fail if the segwit rule is not specified. Calling\u00a0`getblocktemplate`\u00a0without segwit specified is almost certainly a misconfiguration since doing so results in lower rewards for the miner. Failed calls will produce an error message describing how to enable the segwit rule.\r\n\r\nConfiguration option changes\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n-   A warning is printed if an unrecognized section name is used in the configuration file. Recognized sections are\u00a0`[test]`,\u00a0`[main]`, and\u00a0`[regtest]`.\r\n-   Four new options are available for configuring the maximum number of messages that ZMQ will queue in memory (the \"high water mark\") before dropping additional messages. The default value is 1,000, the same as was used for previous releases. See the\u00a0[ZMQ documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage)\u00a0for details.\r\n-   The\u00a0`rpcallowip`\u00a0option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces. Instead, the\u00a0`rpcbind`\u00a0parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration. If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g.\u00a0`docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:9332:9332`\u00a0(this is an extra\u00a0`:9332`\u00a0over the normal Docker port specification).\r\n-   The\u00a0`rpcpassword`\u00a0option now causes a startup error if the password set in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it's ambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a comment.\r\n-   The\u00a0`whitelistforcerelay`\u00a0option is used to relay transactions from whitelisted peers even when not accepted to the mempool. This option now defaults to being off, so that changes in policy and disconnect/ban behavior will not cause a node that is whitelisting another to be dropped by peers. Users can still explicitly enable this behavior with the command line option (and may want to consider\u00a0[contacting](mailto:contact@litecoin.org)\u00a0the Litecoin Core project to let us know about their use-case, as this feature could be deprecated in the future).\r\n\r\nWallet changes\r\n==============\r\n\r\nWhen creating a transaction with a fee above\u00a0`-maxtxfee`\u00a0(default 0.1 LTC), the RPC commands\u00a0`walletcreatefundedpsbt`\u00a0and\u00a0`fundrawtransaction`\u00a0will now fail instead of rounding down the fee. Beware that the\u00a0`feeRate`\u00a0argument is specified in LTC per kilobyte, not litoshi per byte.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   A new short\u00a0[document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\u00a0about the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an RPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different subsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state. A note is added to the\u00a0[REST interface documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)\u00a0indicating that the same rules apply.\r\n-   Further information is added to the\u00a0[JSON-RPC documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\u00a0about how to secure this interface.\r\n-   A new\u00a0[document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/litecoin-conf.md)\u00a0about the\u00a0`litecoin.conf`\u00a0file describes how to use it to configure Litecoin Core.\r\n-   A new document introduces Litecoin Core's BIP174\u00a0[Partially-Signed Litecoin Transactions (PSBT)](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md)\u00a0interface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively work to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions. This is useful for offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin implementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need to interact to generate a complete transaction.\r\n-   The\u00a0[output script descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)\u00a0documentation has been updated with information about new features in this still-developing language for describing the output scripts that a wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as which addresses it wants to know received payments. The language is currently used in multiple new and updated RPCs described in these release notes and is expected to be adapted to other RPCs and to the underlying wallet structure.\r\n\r\nBuild system changes\r\n====================\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`--disable-bip70`\u00a0option may be passed to\u00a0`./configure`\u00a0to prevent Litecoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment protocol or from linking libssl. As the payment protocol has exposed Litecoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don't need BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their exposure to future vulnerabilities.\r\n-   The minimum required version of Qt (when building the GUI) has been increased from 5.2 to 5.5.1 (the\u00a0[depends system](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/depends/README.md)\u00a0provides 5.9.7)\r\n\r\nNew RPCs\r\n========\r\n\r\n-   `getnodeaddresses`\u00a0returns peer addresses known to this node. It may be used to find nodes to connect to without using a DNS seeder.\r\n-   `listwalletdir`\u00a0returns a list of wallets in the wallet directory (either the default wallet directory or the directory configured by the\u00a0`-walletdir`\u00a0parameter).\r\n-   `getrpcinfo`\u00a0returns runtime details of the RPC server. At the moment, it returns an array of the currently active commands and how long they've been running.\r\n-   `deriveaddresses`\u00a0returns one or more addresses corresponding to an\u00a0[output descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n-   `getdescriptorinfo`\u00a0accepts a descriptor and returns information about it, including its computed checksum.\r\n-   `joinpsbts`\u00a0merges multiple distinct PSBTs into a single PSBT. The multiple PSBTs must have different inputs. The resulting PSBT will contain every input and output from all of the PSBTs. Any signatures provided in any of the PSBTs will be dropped.\r\n-   `analyzepsbt`\u00a0examines a PSBT and provides information about what the PSBT contains and the next steps that need to be taken in order to complete the transaction. For each input of a PSBT,\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0provides information about what information is missing for that input, including whether a UTXO needs to be provided, what pubkeys still need to be provided, which scripts need to be provided, and what signatures are still needed. Every input will also list which role is needed to complete that input, and\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0will also list the next role in general needed to complete the PSBT.\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0will also provide the estimated fee rate and estimated virtual size of the completed transaction if it has enough information to do so.\r\n-   `utxoupdatepsbt`\u00a0searches the set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to find the outputs being spent by the partial transaction. PSBTs need to have the UTXOs being spent to be provided because the signing algorithm requires information from the UTXO being spent. For segwit inputs, only the UTXO itself is necessary. For non-segwit outputs, the entire previous transaction is needed so that signers can be sure that they are signing the correct thing. Unfortunately, because the UTXO set only contains UTXOs and not full transactions,\u00a0`utxoupdatepsbt`\u00a0will only add the UTXO for segwit inputs.\r\n\r\nUpdated RPCs\r\n============\r\n\r\nNote: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the Low-level Changes section below.\r\n\r\n-   `getpeerinfo`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`minfeefilter`\u00a0field set to the peer's BIP133 fee filter. You can use this to detect that you have peers that are willing to accept transactions below the default minimum relay fee.\r\n-   The mempool RPCs, such as\u00a0`getrawmempool`\u00a0with\u00a0`verbose=true`, now return an additional \"bip125-replaceable\" value indicating whether the transaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and miners to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of the same inputs.\r\n-   `settxfee`\u00a0previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee below the allowed minimums. It now prints a warning. The special value of \"0\" may still be used to request the minimum value.\r\n-   `getaddressinfo`\u00a0now provides an\u00a0`ischange`\u00a0field indicating whether the wallet used the address in a change output.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0has been updated to support P2WSH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH, and P2SH-P2WSH. Requests for P2WSH and P2SH-P2WSH accept an additional\u00a0`witnessscript`\u00a0parameter.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`warnings`\u00a0field for each request with an array of strings explaining when fields are being ignored or are inconsistent, if there are any.\r\n-   `getaddressinfo`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`solvable`\u00a0boolean field when Litecoin Core knows enough about the address's scriptPubKey, optional redeemScript, and optional witnessScript in order for the wallet to be able to generate an unsigned input spending funds sent to that address.\r\n-   The\u00a0`getaddressinfo`,\u00a0`listunspent`, and\u00a0`scantxoutset`\u00a0RPCs now return an additional\u00a0`desc`\u00a0field that contains an output descriptor containing all key paths and signing information for the address (except for the private key). The\u00a0`desc`\u00a0field is only returned for\u00a0`getaddressinfo`\u00a0and\u00a0`listunspent`\u00a0when the address is solvable.\r\n-   `importprivkey`\u00a0will preserve previously-set labels for addresses or public keys corresponding to the private key being imported. For example, if you imported a watch-only address with the label \"cold wallet\" in earlier releases of Litecoin Core, subsequently importing the private key would default to resetting the address's label to the default empty-string label (\"\"). In this release, the previous label of \"cold wallet\" will be retained. If you optionally specify any label besides the default when calling\u00a0`importprivkey`, the new label will be applied to the address.\r\n-   See the\u00a0[Mining](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/v0.18.1rc1/doc/release-notes-litecoin.md#mining)\u00a0section for changes to\u00a0`getblocktemplate`.\r\n-   `getmininginfo`\u00a0now omits\u00a0`currentblockweight`\u00a0and\u00a0`currentblocktx`\u00a0when a block was never assembled via RPC on this node.\r\n-   The\u00a0`getrawtransaction`\u00a0RPC & REST endpoints no longer check the unspent UTXO set for a transaction. The remaining behaviors are as follows: 1. If a blockhash is provided, check the corresponding block. 2. If no blockhash is provided, check the mempool. 3. If no blockhash is provided but txindex is enabled, also check txindex.\r\n-   `unloadwallet`\u00a0is now synchronous, meaning it will not return until the wallet is fully unloaded.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0now supports importing of addresses from descriptors. A \"desc\" parameter can be provided instead of the \"scriptPubKey\" in a request, as well as an optional range for ranged descriptors to specify the start and end of the range to import. Descriptors with key origin information imported through\u00a0`importmulti`\u00a0will have their key origin information stored in the wallet for use with creating PSBTs. More information about descriptors can be found\u00a0[here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n-   `listunspent`\u00a0has been modified so that it also returns\u00a0`witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output.\r\n-   `createwallet`\u00a0now has an optional\u00a0`blank`\u00a0argument that can be used to create a blank wallet. Blank wallets do not have any keys or HD seed. They cannot be opened in software older than 0.18. Once a blank wallet has a HD seed set (by using\u00a0`sethdseed`) or private keys, scripts, addresses, and other watch only things have been imported, the wallet is no longer blank and can be opened in 0.17.x. Encrypting a blank wallet will also set a HD seed for it.\r\n\r\nDeprecated or removed RPCs\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n-   `signrawtransaction`\u00a0is removed after being deprecated and hidden behind a special configuration option in version 0.17.0.\r\n-   The 'account' API is removed after being deprecated in v0.17. The 'label' API was introduced in v0.17 as a replacement for accounts. See the\u00a0[release notes from v0.17](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.md#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet)\u00a0for a full description of the changes from the 'account' API to the 'label' API.\r\n-   `addwitnessaddress`\u00a0is removed after being deprecated in version 0.16.0.\r\n-   `generate`\u00a0is deprecated and will be fully removed in a subsequent major version. This RPC is only used for testing, but its implementation reached across multiple subsystems (wallet and mining), so it is being deprecated to simplify the wallet-node interface. Projects that are using\u00a0`generate`\u00a0for testing purposes should transition to using the\u00a0`generatetoaddress`\u00a0RPC, which does not require or use the wallet component. Calling\u00a0`generatetoaddress`\u00a0with an address returned by the\u00a0`getnewaddress`\u00a0RPC gives the same functionality as the old\u00a0`generate`\u00a0RPC. To continue using\u00a0`generate`\u00a0in this version, restart litecoind with the\u00a0`-deprecatedrpc=generate`\u00a0configuration option.\r\n-   Be reminded that parts of the\u00a0`validateaddress`\u00a0command have been deprecated and moved to\u00a0`getaddressinfo`. The following deprecated fields have moved to\u00a0`getaddressinfo`:\u00a0`ismine`,\u00a0`iswatchonly`,\u00a0`script`,\u00a0`hex`,\u00a0`pubkeys`,\u00a0`sigsrequired`,\u00a0`pubkey`,\u00a0`embedded`,\u00a0`iscompressed`,\u00a0`label`,\u00a0`timestamp`,\u00a0`hdkeypath`,\u00a0`hdmasterkeyid`.\r\n-   The\u00a0`addresses`\u00a0field has been removed from the\u00a0`validateaddress`\u00a0and\u00a0`getaddressinfo`\u00a0RPC methods. This field was confusing since it referred to public keys using their P2PKH address. Clients should use the\u00a0`embedded.address`\u00a0field for P2SH or P2WSH wrapped addresses, and\u00a0`pubkeys`\u00a0for inspecting multisig participants.\r\n\r\nREST changes\r\n============\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`/rest/blockhashbyheight/`\u00a0endpoint is added for fetching the hash of the block in the current best blockchain based on its height (how many blocks it is after the Genesis Block).\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n-   A new Window menu is added alongside the existing File, Settings, and Help menus. Several items from the other menus that opened new windows have been moved to this new Window menu.\r\n-   In the Send tab, the checkbox for \"pay only the required fee\" has been removed. Instead, the user can simply decrease the value in the Custom Feerate field all the way down to the node's configured minimum relay fee.\r\n-   In the Overview tab, the watch-only balance will be the only balance shown if the wallet was created using the\u00a0`createwallet`\u00a0RPC and the\u00a0`disable_private_keys`\u00a0parameter was set to true.\r\n-   The launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS if compiled with macosx min version greater than 10.11 (use CXXFLAGS=\"-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\" CFLAGS=\"-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\" for setting the deployment sdk version)\r\n\r\nTools\r\n=====\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`litecoin-wallet`\u00a0tool is now distributed alongside Litecoin Core's other executables. Without needing to use any RPCs, this tool can currently create a new wallet file or display some basic information about an existing wallet, such as whether the wallet is encrypted, whether it uses an HD seed, how many transactions it contains, and how many address book entries it has.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis section describes planned changes to Litecoin Core that may affect other Litecoin software and services.\r\n\r\n-   Since version 0.16.0, Litecoin Core's built-in wallet has defaulted to generating P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses when users want to receive payments. These addresses are backwards compatible with all widely-used software. Starting with Litecoin Core 0.20, Litecoin Core will default to native segwit addresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other benefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending to bech32 addresses, and if the Litecoin Core project sees enough additional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving addresses in Litecoin Core 0.20. P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses will continue to be provided if the user requests them in the GUI or by RPC, and anyone who doesn't want the update will be able to configure their default address type. (Similarly, pioneering users who want to change their default now may set the\u00a0`addresstype=bech32`\u00a0configuration option in any Litecoin Core release from 0.16.0 up.)\r\n\r\nDeprecated P2P messages\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n-   BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated. Reject messages have no use case on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most network nodes. Furthermore, they increase bandwidth and can be harmful for privacy and security. It has been possible to disable BIP 61 messages since v0.17 with the\u00a0`-enablebip61=0`\u00a0option. BIP 61 messages will be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed entirely.\r\n\r\nLow-level changes\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis section describes RPC changes mainly useful for testing, mostly not relevant in production. The changes are mentioned for completeness.\r\n\r\nRPC\r\n===\r\n\r\n-   The\u00a0`submitblock`\u00a0RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block was invalid the first time it processed that block, but returned a generic \"duplicate\" rejection message on subsequent occasions it processed the same block. It now always returns the fundamental reason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \"duplicate\" for valid blocks it has already accepted.\r\n-   A new\u00a0`submitheader`\u00a0RPC allows submitting block headers independently from their block. This is likely only useful for testing.\r\n-   The\u00a0`signrawtransactionwithkey`\u00a0and\u00a0`signrawtransactionwithwallet`\u00a0RPCs have been modified so that they also optionally accept a\u00a0`witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output. This is compatible with the change to\u00a0`listunspent`.\r\n-   For the\u00a0`walletprocesspsbt`\u00a0and\u00a0`walletcreatefundedpsbt`\u00a0RPCs, if the\u00a0`bip32derivs`\u00a0parameter is set to true but the key metadata for a public key has not been updated yet, then that key will have a derivation path as if it were just an independent key (i.e. no derivation path and its master fingerprint is itself).\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   The\u00a0`-usehd`\u00a0configuration option was removed in version 0.16. From that version onwards, all new wallets created are hierarchical deterministic wallets. This release makes specifying\u00a0`-usehd`\u00a0an invalid configuration option.\r\n\r\nNetwork\r\n=======\r\n\r\n-   This release allows peers that your node automatically disconnected for misbehavior (e.g. sending invalid data) to reconnect to your node if you have unused incoming connection slots. If your slots fill up, a misbehaving node will be disconnected to make room for nodes without a history of problems (unless the misbehaving node helps your node in some other way, such as by connecting to a part of the Internet from which you don't have many other peers). Previously, Litecoin Core banned the IP addresses of misbehaving peers for a period of time (default of 1 day); this was easily circumvented by attackers with multiple IP addresses. If you manually ban a peer, such as by using the\u00a0`setban`\u00a0RPC, all connections from that peer will still be rejected.\r\n\r\nWallet\r\n======\r\n\r\n-   The key metadata will need to be upgraded the first time that the HD seed is available. For unencrypted wallets this will occur on wallet loading. For encrypted wallets this will occur the first time the wallet is unlocked.\r\n-   Newly encrypted wallets will no longer require restarting the software. Instead such wallets will be completely unloaded and reloaded to achieve the same effect.\r\n-   A sub-project of Litecoin Core now provides Hardware Wallet Interaction (HWI) scripts that allow command-line users to use several popular hardware key management devices with Litecoin Core. See their\u00a0[project page](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI#readme)\u00a0for details.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n========\r\n\r\n-   This release changes the Random Number Generator (RNG) used from OpenSSL to Litecoin Core's own implementation, although entropy gathered by Litecoin Core is fed out to OpenSSL and then read back in when the program needs strong randomness. This moves Litecoin Core a little closer to no longer needing to depend on OpenSSL, a dependency that has caused security issues in the past. The new implementation gathers entropy from multiple sources, including from hardware supporting the rdseed CPU instruction.\r\n\r\nChanges for particular platforms\r\n================================\r\n\r\n-   On macOS, Litecoin Core now opts out of application CPU throttling (\"app nap\") during initial blockchain download, when catching up from over 100 blocks behind the current chain tip, or when reindexing chain data. This helps prevent these operations from taking an excessively long time because the operating system is attempting to conserve power.\r\n\r\nDownload Binaries\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTo download, please visit the download page\u00a0[here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder\u00a0[here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.18.1/).\r\n\r\nPlease use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries. This ensures that the binary you have downloaded has not been tampered with. Linux, MacOS and Win32 cygwin command line GPG instructions are available\u00a0[here](https://download.litecoin.org/README-HOWTO-GPG-VERIFY-TEAM-MEMBERS-KEY.txt). Please also note that we GPG sign the binaries as a convenience to you, the ultimate way to verify the integrity of the builds is to build them yourself using Gitian.
